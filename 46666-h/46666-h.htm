<h2>LATIMER AND RIDLEY<br />

BURNED AT THE STAKE IN OXFORD, A.D. 1555.</h2>


<p>[The fires of Smithfield and the massacre of Bartholomew are truly events
of little consequence in history, if they fail to convince us of the aggressive
and unscrupulous policy of the Roman Catholic Church. The claim of the
Pope, which never has undergone or can undergo any modification whatever,
is nothing less than one of universal supremacy. That claim is asserted now
as broadly and boldly as it was three hundred years ago; when, at the accession
of Mary, Cardinal Pole was sent over as legate to England, for the
reduction of that realm to the obedience of the See of Rome, and for the
extirpation of heresy.</p>

<p>It matters not what may have been the private character of the Cardinal.
He has been represented as a man of mild nature, humane disposition, and
averse to the infamous cruelties which were then perpetrated, the odium of
which has been commonly thrown upon Bishops Gardiner and Bonner. This
much at least is plain, that, whatever may have been his opinion as to the
methods which were employed for the suppression of Protestantism, he did
not deem it expedient to exercise his great power in mitigating the fury or
tempering the cruelty of the persecution. He was a passive witness of the
enormities, and allowed the mandates of the Church to supersede the dictates
of humanity and the merciful teaching of the Saviour.</p>

<p>The records of the reign of Mary ought, especially at the present time, to
be studied by those who, in their zeal for toleration, forget that they have to
contend with most bitter and uncompromising enemies. Not only the
sufferings and fortitude of the martyrs, (among whom were numbered five
bishops, and twenty-one clergymen of the Reformed faith of England,) but the
charges on which they were condemned, and the noble testimony which they
bore, will be found detailed in John Foxe's <i>Acts and Monuments</i>. Next to
that of Archbishop Cranmer, the names of Latimer and Ridley can never be
forgotten in this land, so long as the voice of Protestantism is heard against
Papal superstition and supremacy. Political and ecclesiastical dominion are
things inseparable from each other in the eye of Rome; and wherever she
has succeeded in planting her foot, she has attempted to enforce spiritual
submission, and to extinguish liberty of conscience, by the power of the secular
arm. The following extract, from the work already referred to, narrates the
close of the terrible tragedy which consigned two English prelates to the
flames at Oxford:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Then they brought a faggot, kindled with fire, and laid the same down at Dr
Ridley's feet. To whom master Latimer spake in this manner: 'Be of good comfort,
master Ridley, and play the man. We shall this day light such a candle, by
God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.'</p>

<p>"And so the fire being given unto them, when Dr Ridley saw the fire flaming up
towards him, he cried with a wonderful loud voice, 'In manus tuas, Domine, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>mendo
spiritum meum: Domine, recipe spiritum meum.' And after, repeated this
latter part often in English, 'Lord, Lord, receive my spirit;" master Latimer crying
as vehemently on the other side, 'O Father of heaven, receive my soul!' who received
the flame as it were embracing of it. After that he had stroked his face with his
hands, and as it were bathed them a little in the fire, he soon died (as it appeareth)
with very little pain or none. And thus much concerning the end of this old and
blessed servant of God, master Latimer, for whose laborious travails, fruitful life,
and constant death, the whole realm hath cause to give great thanks to Almighty
God.</p>

<p>"But master Ridley, by reason of the evil making of the fire unto him, because
the wooden faggots were laid about the gorse, and over-high built, the fire burned
first beneath, being kept down by the wood; which when he felt, he desired them
for Christ's sake to let the fire come unto him. Which when his brother-in-law
heard, but not well understood, intending to rid him out of his pain (for the which
cause he gave attendance,) as one in such sorrow not well advised what he did,
heaped faggots upon him, so that he clean covered him, which made the fire more
vehement beneath, that it burned clean all his nether parts, before it once touched
the upper; and that made him leap up and down under the faggots, and often desire
them to let the fire come unto him, saying, 'I cannot burn.' Which indeed appeared
well; for, after his legs were consumed by reason of his struggling through the pain
(whereof he had no release, but only his contentation in God,) he showed that side
toward us clean, shirt and all untouched with flame. Yet in all this torment he
forgot not to call unto God still, having in his mouth, 'Lord, have mercy upon me!'
intermingling his cry, 'Let the fire come unto me: I cannot burn.' In which pangs
he laboured till one of the standers-by with his bill pulled off the faggots above, and
where he saw the fire flame up, he wrested himself unto that side. And when the
flame touched the gunpowder, he was seen to stir no more, but burned on the other
side, falling down at master Latimer's feet; which, some said, happened by reason
that the chain loosed; others said, that he fell over the chain by reason of the poise
of his body, and the weakness of the nether limbs.</p>

<p>"Some said, that before he was like to fall from the stake, he desired them to
hold him to it with their bills. However it was, surely it moved hundreds to tears,
in beholding the horrible sight; for I think there was none that had not clean exiled
all humanity and mercy, which would not have lamented to behold the fury of the
fire so to rage upon their bodies."]</p></div>

<h2>MY NOVEL; OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.&mdash;PART VI.</h2>

<p class="center">BY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<p>Whatever may be the ultimate
success of Miss Jemima Hazeldean's
designs upon Dr Riccabocca, the Machiavellian
sagacity with which the
Italian had counted upon securing the
services of Lenny Fairfield was speedily
and triumphantly established by
the result. No voice of the Parson's,
charmed he ever so wisely, could persuade
the peasant-boy to go and ask
pardon of the young gentleman, to
whom, because he had done as he
was bid, he owed an agonising defeat
and a shameful incarceration. And,
to Mrs Dale's vexation, the widow
took the boy's part. She was deeply
offended at the unjust disgrace Lenny
had undergone in being put in the
stocks; she shared his pride, and
openly approved his spirit. Nor was
it without great difficulty that Lenny
could be induced to resume his lessons
at school&mdash;nay, even to set foot beyond
the precincts of his mother's
holding. The point of the school at
last he yielded, though sullenly; and
the Parson thought it better to temporise
as to the more unpalatable demand.
Unluckily Lenny's apprehensions
of the mockery that awaited
him in the merciless world of his village
were realised. Though Stirn at
first kept his own counsel, the Tinker
blabbed the whole affair. And after
the search instituted for Lenny on the
fatal night, all attempt to hush up
what had passed would have been
impossible. So then Stirn told his
story, as the Tinker had told his own;
both tales were very unfavourable to
Leonard Fairfield. The pattern boy
had broken the Sabbath, fought with
his betters, and been well mauled into
the bargain; the village lad had sided
with Stirn and the authorities in spying
out the misdemeanours of his
equals: therefore Leonard Fairfield,
in both capacities of degraded pattern
boy and baffled spy, could expect no
mercy;&mdash;he was ridiculed in the one,
and hated in the other.</p>

<p>It is true that, in the presence of
the schoolmaster, and under the eye
of Mr Dale, no one openly gave vent
to malignant feelings; but the
moment those checks were removed,
popular persecution began.</p>

<p>Some pointed and mowed at him;
some cursed him for a sneak, and
all shunned his society; voices were
heard in the hedgerows, as he passed
through the village at dusk, "Who
was put in the stocks?&mdash;baa!"
"Who got a bloody nob for playing
spy to Nick Stirn?&mdash;baa!" To resist
this species of aggression would
have been a vain attempt for a wiser
head and a colder temper than our
poor pattern boy's. He took his
resolution at once, and his mother
approved it; and the second or third
day after Dr Riccabocca's return to
the Casino, Lenny Fairfield presented
himself on the terrace with a little
bundle in his hand. "Please, sir,"
said he to the Doctor, who was sitting
cross-legged on the balustrade,
with his red silk umbrella over his
head;
"Please, sir, if you'll be good enough
to take me now, and give me any hole
to sleep in, I'll work for your honour
night and day; and as for the wages,
mother says 'just suit yourself,
sir.'"</p>

<p>"My child," said the Doctor, taking
Lenny by the hand, and looking
at him with the sagacious eye of a
wizard, "I knew you would come!
and Giacomo is already prepared for
you! As to wages, we'll talk of them
by-and-by."</p>

<p>Lenny being thus settled, his mother
looked for some evenings on the
vacant chair, where he had so long
sate in the place of her beloved Mark;
and the chair seemed so comfortless
and desolate, thus left all to itself,
that she could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>Indeed the village had grown as
distasteful to her as to Lenny&mdash;perhaps
more so; and one morning she
hailed the Steward as he was trotting
his hog-maned cob beside the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and bade him tell the Squire that
"she would take it very kind if he
would let her off the six months' notice
for the land and premises she
held&mdash;there were plenty to step into
the place at a much better rent."</p>

<p>"You're a fool," said the good-natured
Steward; "and I'm very glad
you did not speak to that fellow Stirn
instead of to me. You've been doing
extremely well here, and have the
place, I may say, for nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothin' as to rent, sir, but a
great deal as to feeling," said the
widow. "And now Lenny has gone
to work with the foreign gentleman, I
should like to go and live near him."</p>

<p>"Ah yes&mdash;I heard Lenny had
taken himself off to the Casino&mdash;more
fool he; but, bless your heart, 'tis no
distance&mdash;two miles or so. Can't he
come home every night after work?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," exclaimed the widow
almost fiercely; "he shan't come home
here, to be called bad names and
jeered at!&mdash;he whom my dead goodman
was so fond and proud of. No,
sir; we poor folks have our feelings,
as I said to Mrs Dale, and as I will
say to the Squire hisself. Not that I
don't thank him for all favours&mdash;he
be a good gentleman if let alone; but
he says he won't come near us till
Lenny goes and axes pardin. Pardin
for what, I should like to know?
Poor lamb! I wish you could ha' seen
his nose, sir&mdash;as big as your two fists.
Ax pardin! If the Squire had had
such a nose as that, I don't think it's
pardin he'd been ha' axing. But I
let's the passion get the better of me&mdash;I
humbly beg you'll excuse it, sir.
I'm no scollard, as poor Mark was,
and Lenny would have been, if the
Lord had not visited us otherways.
Therefore just get the Squire to let me
go as soon as may be; and as for the
bit o' hay and what's on the grounds
and orchard, the new comer will no
doubt settle that."</p>

<p>The Steward, finding no eloquence of
his could induce the widow to relinquish
her resolution, took her message
to the Squire. Mr Hazeldean, who
was indeed really offended at the boy's
obstinate refusal to make the <i>amende
honorable</i> to Randal Leslie at first
only bestowed a hearty curse or two
on the pride and ingratitude both of
mother and son. It may be supposed,
however, that his second thoughts
were more gentle, since that evening,
though he did not go himself to the
widow, he sent his "Harry." Now,
though Harry was sometimes austere
and <i>brusque</i> enough on her own account,
and in such business as might
especially be transacted between herself
and the cottagers, yet she never
appeared as the delegate of her lord
except in the capacity of a herald of
peace and mediating angel. It was
with good heart, too, that she undertook
this mission, since, as we have
seen, both mother and son were great
favourites of hers. She entered the
cottage with the friendliest beam in
her bright blue eye, and it was with
the softest tone of her frank cordial
voice that she accosted the widow.
But she was no more successful than
the Steward had been. The truth is,
that I don't believe the haughtiest
duke in the three kingdoms is really so
proud as your plain English rural
peasant, nor half so hard to propitiate
and deal with when his sense of
dignity is ruffled. Nor are there many
of my own literary brethren (thin-skinned
creatures though we are) so
sensitively alive to the Public Opinion,
wisely despised by Dr Riccabocca, as
that same peasant. He can endure
a good deal of contumely sometimes,
it is true, from his superiors, (though,
thank Heaven! <i>that</i> he rarely meets,
with unjustly;) but to be looked down
upon, and mocked, and pointed at by
his own equals&mdash;his own little world&mdash;cuts
him to the soul. And if you
can succeed in breaking this pride,
and destroying this sensitiveness, then
he is a lost being. He can never recover
his self-esteem, and you have
chucked him half way&mdash;a stolid, inert,
sullen victim&mdash;to the perdition of the
prison or the convict-ship.</p>

<p>Of this stuff was the nature both of
the widow and her son. Had the
honey of Plato flowed from the tongue
of Mrs Hazeldean, it could not have
turned into sweetness the bitter
spirit upon which it descended. But
Mrs Hazeldean, though an excellent
woman, was rather a bluff plain-spoken
one&mdash;and, after all, she had
some little feeling for the son of a
gentleman, and a decayed fallen gentleman,
who, even by Lenny's account,
had been assailed without any intelli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>gible
provocation; nor could she, with
her strong common sense, attach all
the importance which Mrs Fairfield
did to the unmannerly impertinence
of a few young cubs, which, she said
truly, "would soon die away if no
notice was taken of it." The widow's
mind was made up, and Mrs Hazeldean
departed&mdash;with much chagrin
and some displeasure.</p>

<p>Mrs Fairfield, however, tacitly understood
that the request she had
made was granted, and early one
morning her door was found locked&mdash;the
key left at a neighbour's to be
given to the Steward; and, on farther
inquiry, it was ascertained that her
furniture and effects had been removed
by the errand-cart in the dead
of the night. Lenny had succeeded in
finding a cottage, on the road-side,
not far from the Casino; and there,
with a joyous face, he waited to welcome
his mother to breakfast, and
show how he had spent the night in
arranging her furniture.</p>

<p>"Parson!" cried the Squire, when
all this news came upon him, as he was
walking arm in arm with Mr Dale to
inspect some proposed improvement
in the Alms-house, "this is all your
fault. Why did not you go and talk to
that brute of a boy, and that dolt of a
woman? You've got 'soft sawder
enough,' as Frank calls it in his new-fashioned
slang."</p>

<p>"As if I had not talked myself
hoarse to both!" said the Parson in
a tone of reproachful surprise at the
accusation. "But it was in vain!
O Squire, if you had taken my advice
about the Stocks&mdash;<i>quieta non movere!</i>"</p>

<p>"Bother!" said the Squire. "I
suppose I am to be held up as a tyrant,
a Nero, a Richard the Third, or a
Grand Inquisitor, merely for having
things smart and tidy! Stocks
indeed!&mdash;your friend Rickeybockey
said he was never more comfortable
in his life&mdash;quite enjoyed sitting there.
And what did not hurt Rickeybockey's
dignity (a very gentlemanlike man he
is, when he pleases) ought to be no
such great matter to Master Leonard
Fairfield. But 'tis no use talking!
What's to be done now? The woman
must not starve; and I'm sure she
can't live out of Rickeybockey's wages
to Lenny&mdash;(by the way, I hope he
don't board him upon his and Jackeymo's
leavings: I hear they dine
upon newts and sticklebacks&mdash;faugh!)
I'll tell you what, Parson, now I think
of it&mdash;at the back of the cottage which
she has taken there are some fields
of capital land just vacant. Rickeybockey
wants to have 'em, and sounded
me as to the rent when he was at
the Hall. I only half promised him
the refusal. And he must give up
four or five acres of the best land
round the cottage to the widow&mdash;just
enough for her to manage&mdash;and she
can keep a dairy. If she want capital,
I'll lend her some in your name&mdash;only
don't tell Stirn; and as for the
rent&mdash;we'll talk of that when we see
how she gets on, thankless obstinate
jade that she is! You see," added
the Squire, as if he felt there was
some apology due for this generosity
to an object whom he professed to
consider so ungrateful, "her husband
was a faithful servant, and so&mdash;I wish
you would not stand there staring me
out of countenance, but go down to
the woman at once, or Stirn will have
let the land to Rickeybockey, as sure
as a gun. And hark-ye, Dale, perhaps
you can contrive, if the woman is so
cursedly stiff-backed, not to say the
land is mine, or that it is any favour
I want to do her&mdash;or, in short,
manage it as you can for the best."
Still even this charitable message
failed. The widow knew that the
land was the Squire's, and worth a
good &pound;3 an acre. 'She thanked him
humbly for that and all favours; but
she could not afford to buy cows, and
she did not wish to be beholden to
any one for her living. And Lenny
was well off at Mr Rickeybockey's,
and coming on wonderfully in the
garden way&mdash;and she did not doubt
she could get some washing; at all
events, her haystack would bring in a
good bit of money, and she should do
nicely, thank their honours.'</p>

<p>Nothing farther could be done in
the direct way, but the remark about
the washing suggested some mode of
indirectly benefiting the widow. And
a little time afterwards, the sole laundress
in that immediate neighbourhood
happening to die, a hint from the
Squire obtained from the landlady of
the inn opposite the Casino such
custom as she had to bestow, which
at times was not inconsiderable. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
what with Lenny's wages, (whatever
that mysterious item might be,) the
mother and son contrived to live
without exhibiting any of those physical
signs of fast and abstinence
which Riccabocca and his valet gratuitously
afforded to the student in
animal anatomy.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<p>Of all the wares and commodities in
exchange and barter, wherein so
mainly consists the civilisation of our
modern world, there is not one which
is so carefully weighed&mdash;so accurately
measured&mdash;so plumbed and gauged&mdash;so
doled and scraped&mdash;so poured out
in <i>minima</i> and balanced with scruples&mdash;as
that necessary of social commerce
called "an apology!" If the chemists
were half so careful in vending their
poisons, there would be a notable
diminution in the yearly average of
victims to arsenic and oxalic acid.
But, alas, in the matter of apology,
it is not from the excess of the dose,
but the timid, niggardly, miserly manner
in which it is dispensed, that poor
Humanity is hurried off to the Styx!
How many times does a life depend
on the exact proportions of an apology!
Is it a hairbreadth too short to cover
the scratch for which you want it?
Make your will&mdash;you are a dead man!
A life do I say?&mdash;a hecatomb of lives!
How many wars would have been prevented,
how many thrones would be
standing, dynasties flourishing&mdash;commonwealths
brawling round a <i>bema</i>,
or fitting out galleys for corn and cotton&mdash;if
an inch or two more of apology
had been added to the proffered
ell! But then that plaguy, jealous,
suspicious, old vinegar-faced Honour,
and her partner Pride&mdash;as penny-wise
and pound-foolish a she-skinflint
as herself&mdash;have the monopoly of
the article. And what with the time
they lose in adjusting their spectacles,
hunting in the precise shelf
for the precise quality demanded,
then (quality found) the haggling as
to quantum&mdash;considering whether it
should be Apothecary's weight or
Avoirdupois, or English measure or
Flemish&mdash;and, finally, the hullabaloo
they make if the customer is not perfectly
satisfied with the monstrous
little he gets for his money,&mdash;I don't
wonder, for my part, how one loses
temper and patience, and sends Pride,
Honour, and Apology, all to the devil.
Aristophanes, in his "Comedy of
<i>Peace</i>," insinuates a beautiful allegory
by only suffering that goddess,
though in fact she is his heroine, to
appear as a mute. She takes care
never to open her lips. The shrewd
Greek knew very well that she would
cease to be Peace, if she once began to
chatter. Wherefore, O reader, if ever
you find your pump under the iron heel
of another man's boot, heaven grant
that you may hold your tongue, and not
make things past all endurance and forgiveness
by bawling out for an apology!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<p>But the Squire and his son, Frank,
were large-hearted generous creatures
in the article of apology, as in all
things less skimpingly dealt out. And
seeing that Leonard Fairfield would
offer no plaister to Randal Leslie,
they made amends for his stinginess
by their own prodigality. The Squire
accompanied his son to Rood Hall,
and none of the family choosing to be
at home, the Squire in his own hand,
and from his own head, indited and
composed an epistle which might have
satisfied all the wounds which the dignity
of the Leslies had ever received.</p>

<p>This letter of apology ended with a
hearty request that Randal would
come and spend a few days with his
son. Frank's epistle was to the same
purport, only more Etonian and less
legible.</p>

<p>It was some days before Randal's
replies to these epistles were received.
The replies bore the address of a village
near London, and stated that the
writer was now reading with a tutor
preparatory to entrance at Oxford,
and could not, therefore, accept the
invitation extended to him.</p>

<p>For the rest, Randal expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
himself with good sense, though not
with much generosity. He excused
his participation in the vulgarity of
such a conflict by a bitter but short
allusion to the obstinacy and ignorance
of the village boor; and did not
do what you, my kind reader, certainly
would have done under similar circumstances&mdash;viz.
intercede in behalf of
a brave and unfortunate antagonist.
Most of us like a foe better after we
have fought him&mdash;that is, if we are
the conquering party; this was not
the case with Randal Leslie. There,
so far as the Etonian was concerned,
the matter rested. And the Squire,
irritated that he could not repair
whatever wrong that young gentleman
had sustained, no longer felt a
pang of regret as he passed by Mrs
Fairfield's deserted cottage.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<p>Lenny Fairfield continued to give
great satisfaction to his new employers,
and to profit in many respects
by the familiar kindness with which
he was treated. Riccabocca, who
valued himself on penetrating into
character, had from the first seen
that much stuff of no common quality
and texture was to be found in the
disposition and mind of the English
village boy. On farther acquaintance,
he perceived that, under a
child's innocent simplicity, there were
the workings of an acuteness that
required but development and direction.
He ascertained that the pattern
boy's progress at the village
school proceeded from something
more than mechanical docility and
readiness of comprehension. Lenny
had a keen thirst for knowledge, and
through all the disadvantages of
birth and circumstance, there were the
indications of that natural genius
which converts disadvantages themselves
into stimulants. Still, with the
germs of good qualities lay the embryos
of those which, difficult to separate,
and hard to destroy, often mar
the produce of the soil. With a
remarkable and generous pride in
self-repute, there was some stubbornness;
with great sensibility to kindness,
there was also strong reluctance
to forgive affront.</p>

<p>This mixed nature in an uncultivated
peasant's breast interested
Riccabocca, who, though long secluded
from the commerce of mankind, still
looked upon man as the most various
and entertaining volume which philosophical
research can explore. He
soon accustomed the boy to the tone of
a conversation generally subtle and
suggestive; and Lenny's language
and ideas became insensibly less
rustic and more refined. Then Riccabocca
selected from his library,
small as it was, books that though
elementary, were of a higher cast
than Lenny could have found within
his reach at Hazeldean. Riccabocca
knew the English language well,
better in grammar, construction, and
genius than many a not ill-educated
Englishman; for he had studied it
with the minuteness with which a
scholar studies a dead language, and
amidst his collection he had many of
the books which had formerly served
him for that purpose. These were the
first works he had lent to Lenny.
Meanwhile Jackeymo imparted to the
boy many secrets in practical gardening
and minute husbandry, for at
that day farming in England (some
favoured counties and estates excepted)
was far below the nicety to
which the art has been immemorially
carried in the north of Italy&mdash;where,
indeed, you may travel for miles and
miles as through a series of market-gardens&mdash;so
that, all these things considered,
Leonard Fairfield might be
said to have made a change for the
better. Yet in truth, and looking
below the surface, that might be fair
matter of doubt. For the same reason
which had induced the boy to
fly his native village, he no longer
repaired to the church of Hazeldean.
The old intimate intercourse between
him and the Parson became necessarily
suspended, or bounded to an
occasional kindly visit from the latter&mdash;visits
which grew more rare, and less
familiar, as he found his former pupil
in no want of his services, and wholly
deaf to his mild entreaties to forget
and forgive the past, and come at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
least to his old seat in the parish
church. Lenny still went to church&mdash;a
church a long way off in another
parish&mdash;but the sermons did not do
him the same good as Parson Dale's
had done; and the clergyman, who
had his own flock to attend to, did
not condescend, as Parson Dale
would have done, to explain what
seemed obscure, and enforce what
was profitable, in private talk, with
that stray lamb from another's fold.</p>

<p>Now I question much if all Dr
Riccabocca's sage maxims, though
they were often very moral, and
generally very wise, served to expand
the peasant boy's native good qualities,
and correct his bad, half so well
as the few simple words, not at all
indebted to Machiavelli, which Leonard
had once reverently listened to
when he stood by his father's chair,
yielded up for the moment to the
good Parson, worthy to sit in it; for
Mr Dale had a heart in which all
the fatherless of the parish found
their place. Nor was this loss of
tender, intimate, spiritual lore so
counterbalanced by the greater facilities
for purely intellectual instruction,
as modern enlightenment might presume.
For, without disputing the
advantage of knowledge in a general
way, knowledge, in itself, is not
friendly to content. Its tendency, of
course, is to increase the desires, to
dissatisfy us with what is, in order
to urge progress to what may be;
and, in that progress, what unnoticed
martyrs among the many must fall,
baffled and crushed by the way! To
how large a number will be given
desires they will never realise, dissatisfaction
of the lot from which they
will never rise! <i>Allons!</i> one is viewing
the dark side of the question. It
is all the fault of that confounded
Riccabocca, who has already caused
Lenny Fairfield to lean gloomily on
his spade, and, after looking round
and seeing no one near him, groan
out querulously&mdash;</p>

<p>"And am I born to dig a potato
ground?"</p>

<p><i>Pardieu</i>, my friend Lenny, if you
live to be seventy, and ride in your
carriage;&mdash;and by the help of a dinner-pill
digest a spoonful of curry, you
may sigh to think what a relish there
was in potatoes, roasted in ashes
after you had digged them out of
that ground with your own stout
young hands. Dig on, Lenny Fairfield,
dig on! Dr Riccabocca will tell
you that there was once an illustrious
personage<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who made experience
of two very different occupations&mdash;one
was ruling men, the other
was planting cabbages; he thought
planting cabbages much the pleasanter
of the two!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<p>Dr Riccabocca had secured Lenny
Fairfield, and might therefore be
considered to have ridden his hobby
in the great whirligig with adroitness
and success. But Miss Jemima
was still driving round in her car,
handling the reins, and flourishing
the whip, without apparently having
got an inch nearer to the flying form
of Dr Riccabocca.</p>

<p>Indeed, that excellent and only
too susceptible spinster, with all her
experience of the villany of man, had
never conceived the wretch to be so
thoroughly beyond the reach of
redemption as when Dr Riccabocca
took his leave, and once more interred
himself amidst the solitudes of the
Casino, without having made any
formal renunciation of his criminal
celibacy. For some days she shut
herself up in her own chamber, and
brooded with more than her usual
gloomy satisfaction on the certainty
of the approaching crash. Indeed,
many signs of that universal calamity
which, while the visit of Riccabocca
lasted, she had permitted herself to
consider ambiguous, now became luminously
apparent. Even the newspaper,
which during that credulous
and happy period had given half a
column to Births and Marriages, now
bore an ominously long catalogue of
Deaths; so that it seemed as if the
whole population had lost heart, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>had no chance of repairing its daily
losses. The leading articles spoke,
with the obscurity of a Pythian, of an
impending <span class="smcap">CRISIS</span>. Monstrous turnips
sprouted out from the paragraphs
devoted to General News. Cows bore
calves with two heads, whales were
stranded in the Humber, showers of
frogs descended in the High Street
of Cheltenham.</p>

<p>All these symptoms of the world's
decrepitude and consummation, which
by the side of the fascinating Riccabocca
might admit of some doubt as
to their origin and cause, now, conjoined
with the worst of all, viz.&mdash;the
frightfully progressive wickedness of
man&mdash;left to Miss Jemima, no ray
of hope save that afforded by the
reflection that she could contemplate
the wreck of matter without a
single sentiment of regret.</p>

<p>Mrs Dale, however, by no means
shared the despondency of her fair
friend, and, having gained access to
Miss Jemima's chamber, succeeded,
though not without difficulty, in her
kindly attempts to cheer the drooping
spirits of that female misanthropist.
Nor, in her benevolent desire to speed
the car of Miss Jemima to its hymeneal
goal, was Mrs Dale so cruel
towards her male friend, Dr Riccabocca,
as she seemed to her husband.
For Mrs Dale was a woman of
shrewdness and penetration, as most
quick-tempered women are; and she
knew that Miss Jemima was one of
those excellent young ladies who
are likely to value a husband in
proportion to the difficulty of
obtaining him. In fact, my readers
of both sexes must often have met, in
the course of their experience, with
that peculiar sort of feminine disposition,
which requires the warmth of
the conjugal hearth to develop all its
native good qualities; nor is it to
be blamed overmuch if, innocently
aware of this tendency in its nature,
it turns towards what is best fitted for
its growth and improvement, by laws
akin to those which make the sunflower
turn to the sun, or the willow
to the stream. Ladies of this disposition,
permanently thwarted in their
affectionate bias, gradually languish
away into intellectual inanition, or
sprout out into those abnormal eccentricities
which are classed under the
general name of "oddity" or "character."
But, once admitted to their
proper soil, it is astonishing what
healthful improvement takes place&mdash;how
the poor heart, before starved
and stinted of nourishment, throws
out its suckers, and bursts into bloom
and fruit. And thus many a belle
from whom the beaux have stood aloof,
only because the puppies think she
could be had for the asking, they see
afterwards settled down into true wife
and fond mother, with amaze at their
former disparagement, and a sigh at
their blind hardness of heart.</p>

<p>In all probability, Mrs Dale took
this view of the subject; and certainly,
in addition to all the hitherto dormant
virtues which would be awakened in
Miss Jemima when fairly Mrs Riccabocca,
she counted somewhat upon the
mere worldly advantage which such a
match would bestow upon the exile. So
respectable a connection with one of
the oldest, wealthiest, and most popular
families in the shire, would in itself
give him a position not to be despised
by a poor stranger in the land; and
though the interest of Miss Jemima's
dowry might not be much, regarded in
the light of English pounds, (not
Milanese <i>lire</i>,) still it would suffice to
prevent that gradual process of dematerialisation
which the lengthened diet
upon minnows and sticklebacks had
already made apparent in the fine and
slow-evanishing form of the philosopher.</p>

<p>Like all persons convinced of the
expediency of a thing, Mrs Dale saw
nothing wanting but opportunities to
insure its success. And that these
might be forthcoming, she not only
renewed with greater frequency, and
more urgent instance than ever, her
friendly invitations to Riccabocca to
drink tea and spend the evening, but
she artfully so chafed the Squire on
his sore point of hospitality, that the
Doctor received weekly a pressing
solicitation to dine and sleep at the
Hall.</p>

<p>At first the Italian pished and
grunted, and said <i>Cospetto</i>, and <i>Per
Bacco</i>, and <i>Diavolo</i>, and tried to creep
out of so much proffered courtesy.
But, like all single gentlemen, he was
a little under the tyrannical influence
of his faithful servant; and Jackeymo,
though he could bear starving as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
as his master when necessary, still,
when he had the option, preferred
roast beef and plum-pudding. Moreover,
that vain and incautious confidence
of Riccabocca, touching the vast
sum at his command, and with no
heavier drawback than that of so
amiable a lady as Miss Jemima&mdash;who
had already shown him (Jackeymo)
many little delicate attentions&mdash;had
greatly whetted the cupidity which
was in the servant's Italian nature:
a cupidity the more keen because,
long debarred its legitimate exercise
on his own mercenary interests, he
carried it all to the account of his
master's!</p>

<p>Thus tempted by his enemy, and
betrayed by his servant, the unfortunate
Riccabocca fell, though with
eyes not unblinded, into the hospitable
snares extended for the destruction of
his&mdash;celibacy! He went often to the
parsonage, often to the Hall, and by
degrees the sweets of the social domestic
life, long denied him, began to
exercise their enervating charm upon
the stoicism of our poor exile. Frank
had now returned to Eton. An unexpected
invitation had carried off
Captain Higginbotham to pass a few
weeks at Bath with a distant relation,
who had lately returned from India,
and who, as rich as Cr&oelig;sus, felt so
estranged and solitary in his native
isle that, when the Captain "claimed
kindred there," to his own amaze
"he had his claims allowed;"
while a very protracted sitting of
Parliament still delayed in London
the Squire's habitual visitors in the
later summer; so that&mdash;a chasm thus
made in his society&mdash;Mr Hazeldean
welcomed with no hollow cordiality
the diversion or distraction he found
in the foreigner's companionship.
Thus, with pleasure to all parties, and
strong hopes to the two female conspirators,
the intimacy between the
Casino and Hall rapidly thickened;
but still not a word resembling a distinct
proposal did Dr Riccabocca
breathe. And still, if such an idea
obtruded itself on his mind, it was
chased therefrom with so determined
a <i>Diavolo</i> that perhaps, if not the end
of the world, at least the end of Miss
Jemima's tenure in it, might have
approached, and seen her still Miss
Jemima, but for a certain letter with
a foreign post-mark that reached the
Doctor one Tuesday morning.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<p>The servant saw that something
had gone wrong, and, under pretence
of syringing the orange-trees, he lingered
near his master, and peered
through the sunny leaves upon Riccabocca's
melancholy brows.</p>

<p>The Doctor sighed heavily. Nor did
he, as was his wont, after some such
sigh, mechanically take up that dear
comforter, the pipe. But though the
tobacco-pouch lay by his side on the
balustrade, and the pipe stood against
the wall between his knees, childlike
lifting up its lips to the customary
caress&mdash;he heeded neither the one nor
the other, but laid the letter silently on
his lap, and fixed his eyes upon the
ground.</p>

<p>"It must be bad news indeed!"
thought Jackeymo, and desisted from
his work. Approaching his master,
he took up the pipe and the tobacco-pouch,
and filled the bowl slowly,
glancing all the while to that dark
musing face on which, when abandoned
by the expression of intellectual
vivacity or the exquisite smile of
Italian courtesy, the deep downward
lines revealed the characters of sorrow.
Jackeymo did not venture to
speak; but the continued silence of
his master disturbed him much. He
laid that peculiar tinder which your
smokers use upon the steel, and struck
the spark&mdash;still not a word, nor did
Riccabocca stretch forth his hand.</p>

<p>"I never knew him in this taking
before," thought Jackeymo; and
delicately he insinuated the neck of
the pipe into the nerveless fingers of
the hand that lay supine on those
quiet knees&mdash;the pipe fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>Jackeymo crossed himself, and began
praying to his sainted namesake
with great fervour.</p>

<p>The Doctor rose slowly, and, as if
with effort, he walked once or twice
to and fro the terrace; and then he
halted abruptly, and said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Friend!"</p>

<p>"Blessed Monsignore San Giacomo,
I knew thou wouldst hear me!"
cried the servant; and he raised his
master's hand to his lips, then abruptly
turned away and wiped his eyes.
"Friend," repeated Riccabocca, and
this time with a tremulous emphasis,
and in the softest tone of a voice
never wholly without the music of
the sweet South, "I would talk to
thee of my child."&mdash;</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<p>"The letter, then, relates to the
Signorina. She is well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is well now. She is in
our native Italy."</p>

<p>Jackeymo raised his eyes involuntarily
towards the orange-trees, and
the morning breeze swept by and
bore to him the odour of their blossoms.</p>

<p>"Those are sweet even here, with
care," said he, pointing to the trees.
"I think I have said that before to
the Padrone."</p>

<p>But Riccabocca was now looking
again at the letter, and did not notice
either the gesture or the remark of
his servant.</p>

<p>"My aunt is no more!" said he,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"We will pray for her soul!" answered
Jackeymo solemnly. "But
she was very old, and had been a
long time ailing. Let it not grieve
the Padrone too keenly: at that age,
and with those infirmities, death
comes as a friend."</p>

<p>"Peace be to her dust!" returned
the Italian. "If she had her faults,
be they now forgotten for ever; and
in the hour of my danger and distress,
she sheltered my infant! That shelter
is destroyed. This letter is from
the priest, her confessor. You know
that she had nothing at her own disposal
to bequeath my child, and her
property passes to the male heir&mdash;mine
enemy."</p>

<p>"Traitor!" muttered Jackeymo;
and his right hand seemed to feel for
the weapon which the Italians of
lower rank often openly wear in their
girdles.</p>

<p>"The priest," resumed Riccabocca
calmly, "has rightly judged in removing
my child as a guest from the
house in which my enemy enters as
lord."</p>

<p>"And where is the Signorina?"</p>

<p>"With that poor priest. See, Giacomo&mdash;here,
here&mdash;this is her handwriting
at the end of the letter&mdash;the
first lines she ever yet traced to me."</p>

<p>Jackeymo took off his hat, and
looked reverently on the large characters
of a child's writing. But
large as they were, they seemed indistinct,
for the paper was blistered
with the child's tears; and on the
place where they had <i>not</i> fallen, there
was a round fresh moist stain of the
tear that had dropped from the lids
of the father. Riccabocca renewed,&mdash;"The
priest recommends a convent."</p>

<p>"To the devil with the priest!"
cried the servant; then crossing himself
rapidly, he added, "I did not
mean that, Monsignore San Giacomo&mdash;forgive
me! But your Excellency<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
does not think of making a nun of his
only child!"</p>

<p>"And yet why not?" said Riccabocca
mournfully; "what can I give
her in the world? Is the land of the
stranger a better refuge than the
home of peace in her native clime?"</p>

<p>"In the land of the stranger beats
her father's heart!"</p>

<p>"And if that beat were stilled,
what then? Ill fares the life that a
single death can bereave of all. In a
convent at least (and the priest's influence
can obtain her that asylum
amongst her equals and amidst her
sex) she is safe from trial and from
penury&mdash;to her grave."</p>

<p>"Penury! Just see how rich we
shall be when we take those fields at
Michaelmas."</p>

<p>"<i>Pazzie!</i>" (follies) said Riccabocca
listlessly. "Are these suns more
serene than ours, or the soil more
fertile? Yet in our own Italy, saith
the proverb, 'he who sows land reaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>more care than corn.' It were different,"
continued the father after a
pause, and in a more irresolute tone,
"if I had some independence, however
small, to count on&mdash;nay, if among
all my tribe of dainty relatives there
were but one female who would
accompany Violante to the exile's
hearth&mdash;Ishmael had his Hagar. But
how can we two rough-bearded men
provide for all the nameless wants
and cares of a frail female child? And
she has been so delicately reared&mdash;the
woman-child needs the fostering hand
and tender eye of a woman."</p>

<p>"And with a word," said Jackeymo
resolutely, "the Padrone might
secure to his child all that he needs,
to save her from the sepulchre of a
convent; and ere the autumn leaves
fall, she might be sitting on his knee.
Padrone, do not think that you can
conceal from me the truth, that you
love your child better than all things
in the world&mdash;now the Patria is as
dead to you as the dust of your
fathers&mdash;and your heart-strings
would crack with the effort to tear
her from them, and consign her to a
convent. Padrone, never again to
hear her voice&mdash;never again to see
her face! Those little arms that
twined round your neck that dark
night, when we fled fast for life and
freedom, and you said, as you felt
their clasp, 'Friend, all is not yet
lost!'"</p>

<p>"Giacomo!" exclaimed the father
reproachfully, and his voice seemed
to choke him. Riccabocca turned
away, and walked restlessly to and
fro the terrace; then, lifting his arms
with a wild gesture as he still continued
his long irregular strides, he
muttered, "Yes, heaven is my witness
that I could have borne reverse
and banishment without a murmur,
had I permitted myself that young
partner in exile and privation.
Heaven is my witness that, if I hesitate
now, it is because I would not
listen to my own selfish heart. Yet
never, never to see her again&mdash;my
child! And it was but as the infant
that I beheld her! O Friend,
friend&mdash;" (and, stopping short with a
burst of uncontrollable emotion, he
bowed his head upon his servant's
shoulder;) "thou knowest what I
have endured and suffered at my
hearth, as in my country; the wrong,
the perfidy, the&mdash;the&mdash;" His
voice again failed him; he clung to
his servant's breast, and his whole
frame shook.</p>

<p>"But your child, the innocent one&mdash;think
now only of her!" faltered
Giacomo, struggling with his own
sobs.</p>

<p>"True, only of her," replied the
exile, raising his face&mdash;"only of her.
Put aside thy thoughts for myself,
friend&mdash;counsel me. If I were to send
for Violante, and if, transplanted to
these keen airs, she drooped and died&mdash;look,
look&mdash;the priest says that she
needs such tender care; or if I myself
were summoned from the world,
to leave her in it alone, friendless,
homeless, breadless perhaps, at the
age of woman's sharpest trial against
temptation, would she not live to
mourn the cruel egotism that closed
on her infant innocence the gates of
the House of God?"</p>

<p>Giacomo was appalled by this appeal;
and indeed Riccabocca had never
before thus reverently spoken of the
cloister. In his hours of philosophy,
he was wont to sneer at monks and
nuns, priesthood and superstition.
But now, in that hour of emotion, the
Old Religion reclaimed her empire;
and the sceptical world-wise man,
thinking only of his child, spoke and
felt with a child's simple faith.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<p>"But again I say," murmured
Jackeymo scarce audibly, and after a
long silence, "if the Padrone would
make up his mind&mdash;to marry!"</p>

<p>He expected that his master would
start up in his customary indignation
at such a suggestion&mdash;nay, he might
not have been sorry so to have
changed the current of feeling; but
the poor Italian only winced slightly,
and mildly withdrawing himself from
his servant's supporting arm, again
paced the terrace, but this time quietly
and in silence. A quarter of an hour
thus passed. "Give me the pipe,"
said Dr Riccabocca, passing into the
Belvidere.</p>

<p>Jackeymo again struck the spark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
and, wonderfully relieved at the
Padrone's return to his usual adviser,
mentally besought his sainted namesake
to bestow a double portion of
soothing wisdom on the benignant
influences of the weed.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<p>Dr Riccabocca had been some little
time in the solitude of the Belvidere,
when Lenny Fairfield, not knowing
that his employer was therein, entered
to lay down a book which the Doctor
had lent him, with injunctions to
leave on a certain table when done
with. Riccabocca looked up at the
sound of the young peasant's step.</p>

<p>"I beg your honour's pardon&mdash;I
did not know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind; lay the book there.
I wish to speak with you. You
look well, my child; this air agrees
with you as well as that of Hazeldean?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Yet it is higher ground, more
exposed?"</p>

<p>"That can hardly be, sir," said
Lenny; "there are many plants
grow here which don't flourish at the
Squire's. The hill yonder keeps off
the east wind, and the place lays to
the south."</p>

<p>"Lies, not <i>lays</i>, Lenny. What
are the principal complaints in these
parts?"</p>

<p>"Eh, sir?"</p>

<p>"I mean what maladies, what
diseases?"</p>

<p>"I never beard tell of any, sir,
except the rheumatism."</p>

<p>"No low fevers?&mdash;no consumption?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of them, sir."</p>

<p>Riccabocca drew a long breath, as
if relieved.</p>

<p>"That seems a very kind family at
the Hall."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say against it,"
answered Lenny bluntly. "I have
not been treated justly. But as that
book says, sir, 'It is not every one
who comes into the world with a
silver spoon in his mouth.'"</p>

<p>Little thought the Doctor that
those wise maxims may leave sore
thoughts behind them. He was too
occupied with the subject most at his
own heart to think then of what was
in Lenny Fairfield's.</p>

<p>"Yes; a kind, English, domestic
family. Did you see much of Miss
Hazeldean?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as of the Lady."</p>

<p>"Is she liked in the village, think
you?"</p>

<p>"Miss Jemima? Yes. She never
did harm. Her little dog bit me
once&mdash;she did not ask me to beg its
pardon, she asked mine! She's a
very nice young lady; the girls say
she's very affable; and," added Lenny
with a smile, "there are always more
weddings going on when she's down
at the Hall."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Riccabocca. Then,
after a long whiff, "Did you ever
see her play with the little children?
Is she fond of children, do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Lord, sir, you guess everything!
She's never so pleased as when she's
playing with the babies."</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted Riccabocca.
"Babies&mdash;well, that's womanlike.
I don't mean exactly babies, but
when they're older&mdash;little girls."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, I daresay; but,"
said Lenny primly, "I never as yet
kept company with the little girls."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Lenny; be equally
discreet all your life. Mrs Dale is
very intimate with Miss Hazeldean&mdash;more
than with the Squire's lady.
Why is that, think you?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Leonard shrewdly,
"Mrs Dale has her little tempers,
though she's a very good lady; and
Madam Hazeldean is rather high,
and has a spirit. But Miss Jemima
is so soft: any one could live with
Miss Jemima, as Joe and the servants
say at the Hall."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Get my hat out of the
parlour, and&mdash;just bring a clothesbrush,
Lenny. A fine sunny day for
a walk."</p>

<p>After this most mean and dishonourable
inquisition into the character
and popular repute of Miss
Hazeldean, Signore Riccabocca seemed
as much cheered up and elated as if
he had committed some very noble
action; and he walked forth in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
direction of the Hall with a far
lighter and livelier step than that
with which he had paced the terrace.</p>

<p>"Monsignore San Giacomo, by
thy help and the pipe's, the Padrone
shall have his child!" muttered
the servant, looking up from the garden.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<p>Yet Dr Riccabocca was not rash.
The man who wants his wedding-garment
to fit him must allow plenty
of time for the measure. But, from
that day, the Italian notably changed
his manner towards Miss Hazeldean.
He ceased that profusion of compliment
in which he had hitherto carried off in
safety all serious meaning. For indeed
the Doctor considered that compliments,
to a single gentleman, were
what the inky liquid it dispenses is to
the cuttle-fish, that by obscuring the
water sails away from its enemy.
Neither did he, as before, avoid prolonged
conversations with that young
lady, and contrive to escape from
all solitary rambles by her side. On
the contrary, he now sought every
occasion to be in her society; and,
entirely dropping the language of
gallantry, he assumed something of
the earnest tone of friendship. He
bent down his intellect to examine
and plumb her own. To use a very
homely simile, he blew away that
froth which there is on the surface of
mere acquaintanceships, especially
with the opposite sex; and which, while
it lasts, scarce allows you to distinguish
between small beer and double X.
Apparently Dr Riccabocca was satisfied
with his scrutiny&mdash;at all events,
under that froth there was no taste of
bitter. The Italian might not find
any great strength of intellect in Miss
Jemima, but he found that, disentangled
from many little whims and
foibles&mdash;which he had himself the
sense to perceive were harmless
enough if they lasted, and not so
absolutely constitutional but what
they might be removed by a tender
hand&mdash;Miss Hazeldean had quite
enough sense to comprehend the plain
duties of married life; and if the sense
could fail, it found a substitute in
good old homely English principles
and the instincts of amiable kindly
feelings.</p>

<p>I know not how it is, but your
very clever man never seems to care
so much as your less gifted mortals
for cleverness in his helpmate. Your
scholars, and poets, and ministers of
state, are more often than not found
assorted with exceedingly humdrum
good sort of women, and apparently
like them all the better for their
deficiencies. Just see how happily
Racine lived with his wife, and what
an angel he thought her, and yet she
had never read his plays. Certainly
Goethe never troubled the lady who
called him "Mr Privy Councillor"
with whims about 'monads,' and speculations
on 'colour,' nor those stiff
metaphysical problems on which one
breaks one's shins in the Second Part
of the Faust. Probably it may be
that such great geniuses&mdash;knowing
that, as compared with themselves,
there is little difference between your
clever woman and your humdrum
woman&mdash;merge at once all minor distinctions,
relinquish all attempts that
could not but prove unsatisfactory, at
sympathy in hard intellectual pursuits,
and are quite satisfied to establish
that tie which, after all, best resists
wear and tear&mdash;viz. the tough household
bond between one human heart
and another.</p>

<p>At all events, this, I suspect, was
the reasoning of Dr Riccabocca, when
one morning, after a long walk with
Miss Hazeldean, he muttered to himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Duro con duro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non fece mai buon muro."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Which may bear the paraphrase,
"Bricks without mortar would make
a very bad wall." There was quite
enough in Miss Jemima's disposition
to make excellent mortar: the Doctor
took the bricks to himself.</p>

<p>When his examination was concluded,
our philosopher symbolically
evinced the result he had arrived at
by a very simple proceeding on his
part&mdash;which would have puzzled you
greatly if you had not paused, and
meditated thereon, till you saw all
that it implied. <i>Dr Riccabocca took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
off his spectacles!</i> He wiped them
carefully, put them into their shagreen
case, and locked them in his bureau:&mdash;that
is to say, he left off wearing his
spectacles.</p>

<p>You will observe that there was
a wonderful depth of meaning in
that critical symptom, whether it be
regarded as a sign outward, positive
and explicit; or a sign metaphysical,
mystical, and esoteric. For,
as to the last&mdash;it denoted that the
task of the spectacles was over; that,
when a philosopher has made up his
mind to marry, it is better henceforth
to be shortsighted&mdash;nay, even
somewhat purblind&mdash;than to be always
scrutinising the domestic felicity,
to which he is about to resign himself,
through a pair of cold unillusory
barnacles. And for the things beyond
the hearth, if he cannot see
without spectacles, is he not about
to ally to his own defective vision
a good sharp pair of eyes, never at
fault where his interests are concerned?
On the other hand, regarded
positively, categorically, and
explicitly, Dr Riccabocca, by laying
aside those spectacles, signified that
he was about to commence that
happy initiation of courtship when
every man, be he ever so much a
philosopher, wishes to look as young
and as handsome as time and nature
will allow. Vain task to speed the
soft language of the eyes, through the
medium of those glassy interpreters!
I remember, for my own part, that
once, on a visit to Adelaide, I was in
great danger of falling in love&mdash;with
a young lady, too, who would have
brought me a very good fortune&mdash;when
she suddenly produced from her
reticule a very neat pair of No. 4,
set in tortoise-shell, and, fixing upon
me their Gorgon gaze, froze the
astonished Cupid into stone! And I
hold it a great proof of the wisdom of
Riccabocca, and of his vast experience,
in mankind, that he was not above
the consideration of what your pseudo
sages would have regarded as foppish
and ridiculous trifles. It argued all
the better for that happiness which is
our being's end and aim, that, in condescending
to play the lover, he put
those unbecoming petrifiers under
lock and key.</p>

<p>And certainly, now the spectacles
were abandoned, it was impossible to
deny that the Italian had remarkably
handsome eyes. Even through the
spectacles, or lifted a little above them,
they were always bright and expressive;
but without those adjuncts, the
blaze was softer and more tempered:
they had that look which the French
call <i>velout&eacute;</i>, or velvety; and he appeared
altogether ten years younger.
If our Ulysses, thus rejuvenated by
his Minerva, has not fully made up
his mind to make a Penelope of Miss
Jemima, all I can say is, that he is
worse than Polyphemus who was only
an Anthropophagos;&mdash;</p>

<p>He preys upon the weaker sex, and
is a&mdash;Gynopophagite!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p>"And you commission me, then, to
speak to our dear Jemima?" said
Mrs Dale joyfully, and without any
bitterness whatever in that "dear."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"Nay, before
speaking to Miss Hazeldean, it would
surely be proper to know how far my
addresses would be acceptable to the
family."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"Ah!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"The Squire
is of course the head of the family."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale</span> (absent and <i>distrait</i>.)&mdash;"The
Squire&mdash;yes, very true&mdash;quite
proper." (Then looking up and with
<i>naivet&eacute;</i>)&mdash;"Can you believe me, I
never thought of the Squire. And he
is such an odd man, and has so many
English prejudices, that really&mdash;dear
me, how vexatious that it should
never once have occurred to me that
Mr Hazeldean had a voice in the
matter! Indeed, the relationship is
so distant&mdash;it is not like being her
father; and Jemima is of age, and
can do as she pleases; and&mdash;but, as
you say, it is quite proper that he
should be consulted as the head of
the family."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"And you think
that the Squire of Hazeldean might
reject my alliance! Pshaw! that's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
grand word indeed;&mdash;I mean, that he
might object very reasonably to his
cousin's marriage with a foreigner, of
whom he can know nothing, except
that which in all countries is disreputable,
and is said in this to be
criminal&mdash;poverty."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale</span>, (kindly.)&mdash;"You misjudge
us poor English people, and you
wrong the Squire, heaven bless him!
for we were poor enough when he
singled out my husband from a hundred
for the minister of his parish,
for his neighbour and his friend. I
will speak to him fearlessly&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"And frankly.
And now I have used that word, let
me go on with the confession which
your kindly readiness, my fair friend,
somewhat interrupted. I said that if
I might presume to think my addresses
would be acceptable to Miss Hazeldean
and her family, I was too
sensible of her amiable qualities not
to&mdash;not to&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale</span> (with demure archness.)&mdash;"Not
to be the happiest of
men&mdash;that's the customary English
phrase, Doctor."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca</span> (gallantly.)&mdash;"There
cannot be a better. But," continued
he seriously, "I wish it first to be
understood that I have&mdash;been married
before."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale</span> (astonished.)&mdash;"Married
before!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"And that I have
an only child, dear to me&mdash;inexpressibly
dear. That child, a daughter,
has hitherto lived abroad; circumstances
now render it desirable that
she should make her home with me.
And I own fairly that nothing has so
attached me to Miss Hazeldean, nor
so induced my desire for our matrimonial
connection, as my belief that
she has the heart and the temper to
become a kind mother to my little
one."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale</span> (with feeling and
warmth.)&mdash;"You judge her, rightly
there."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Riccabocca.</span>&mdash;"Now, in pecuniary
matters, as you may conjecture from
my mode of life, I have nothing to
offer to Miss Hazeldean correspondent
with her own fortune, whatever
that may be!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs Dale.</span>&mdash;"That difficulty is
obviated by settling Miss Hazeldean's
fortune on herself, which is customary
in such cases."</p>

<p>Dr Riccabocca's face lengthened.
"And my child, then?" said he feelingly.
There was something in that
appeal so alien from all sordid and
merely personal mercenary motives,
that Mrs Dale could not have had the
heart to make the very rational suggestion&mdash;"But
that child is not Jemima's,
and you may have children
by her."</p>

<p>She was touched, and replied
hesitatingly&mdash;"But, from what you
and Jemima may jointly possess, you
can save something annually&mdash;you
can insure your life for your child.
We did so when our poor child whom
we lost was born," (the tears rushed
into Mrs Dale's eyes;) "and I fear
that Charles still insures his life for
my sake, though heaven knows that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>The tears burst out. That little
heart, quick and petulant though it
was, had not a fibre of the elastic
muscular tissues which are mercifully
bestowed on the hearts of predestined
widows. Dr Riccabocca could not
pursue the subject of life insurances
further. But the idea&mdash;which had
never occurred to the foreigner before,
though so familiar to us English people
when only possessed of a life income&mdash;pleased
him greatly. I will do
him the justice to say, that he preferred
it to the thought of actually
appropriating to himself and to his child
a portion of Miss Hazeldean's dower.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he took his leave,
and Mrs Dale hastened to seek her
husband in his study, inform him of
the success of her matrimonial scheme,
and consult him as to the chance of
the Squire's acquiescence therein.
"You see," said she hesitatingly,
"though the Squire might be glad to
see Jemima married to some Englishman,
yet, if he asks who and what is
this Dr Riccabocca, how am I to answer
him?"</p>

<p>"You should have thought of that
before," said Mr Dale, with unwonted
asperity; "and, indeed, if I had ever
believed anything serious could come
out of what seemed to me so absurd,
I should long since have requested
you not to interfere in such matters."
"Good heavens!" continued the Parson,
changing colour, "if we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
have assisted, underhand as it were,
to introduce into the family of a man
to whom we owe so much, a connexion
that he would dislike! how
base we should be!&mdash;how ungrateful!"</p>

<p>Poor Mrs Dale was frightened by
this speech, and still more by her
husband's consternation and displeasure.
To do Mrs Dale justice, whenever
her mild partner was really either
grieved or offended, her little temper
vanished&mdash;she became as meek as a
lamb. As soon as she recovered the
first shock she experienced, she hastened
to dissipate the Parson's apprehensions.
She assured him that she
was convinced that, if the Squire disapproved
of Riccabocca's pretensions,
the Italian would withdraw them at
once, and Miss Hazeldean would never
know of his proposals. Therefore, in
that case, no harm would be done.</p>

<p>This assurance coinciding with Mr
Dale's convictions as to Riccabocca's
scruples on the point of honour, tended
much to compose the good man; and
if he did not, as my reader of the
gentler sex would from him, feel
alarm lest Miss Jemima's affections
should have been irretrievably engaged,
and her happiness thus put in
jeopardy by the Squire's refusal, it
was not that the Parson wanted tenderness
of heart, but experience in
womankind; and he believed, very
erroneously, that Miss Jemima Hazeldean
was not one upon whom a
disappointment of that kind would
produce a lasting impression. Therefore
Mr Dale, after a pause of consideration,
said kindly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, don't vex yourself&mdash;and I
was to blame quite as much as you.
But, indeed, I should have thought it
easier for the Squire to have transplanted
one of his tall cedars into his
kitchen-garden, than for you to inveigle
Dr Riccabocca into matrimonial
intentions. But a man who could
voluntarily put himself into the Parish
Stocks for the sake of experiment,
must be capable of anything! However,
I think it better that I, rather
than yourself, should speak to the
Squire, and I will go at once."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p>The Parson put on the shovel hat,
which&mdash;conjoined with other details
in his dress peculiarly clerical, and
already, even then, beginning to be
out of fashion with churchmen&mdash;had
served to fix upon him, emphatically,
the dignified but antiquated style and
cognomen of "Parson"; and took his
way towards the Home Farm, at which
he expected to find the Squire. But
he had scarcely entered upon the village
green when he beheld Mr Hazeldean
leaning both hands on his stick,
and gazing intently upon the Parish
Stocks. Now, sorry am I to say that,
ever since the Hegira of Lenny and
his mother, the Anti-Stockian and Revolutionary
spirit in Hazeldean, which
the memorable homily of our Parson
had awhile averted or suspended,
had broken forth afresh. For though,
while Lenny was present to be mowed
and jeered at, there had been no pity
for him, yet no sooner was he removed
from the scene of trial, than
a universal compassion for the barbarous
usage he had received produced
what is called "the reaction of public
opinion." Not that those who had
mowed and jeered repented them of
their mockery, or considered themselves
in the slightest degree the cause
of his expatriation. No; they, with
the rest of the villagers, laid all the
blame upon the Stocks. It was not
to be expected that a lad of such
exemplary character could be thrust
into that place of ignominy, and not
be sensible of the affront. And who,
in the whole village, was safe, if such
goings-on and puttings-in were to be
tolerated in silence, and at the expense
of the very best and quietest lad the
village had ever known? Thus, a few
days after the widow's departure, the
Stocks was again the object of midnight
desecration: it was bedaubed
and be-scratched&mdash;it was hacked and
hewed&mdash;it was scrawled all over with
pithy lamentations for Lenny, and laconic
execrations on tyrants. Night
after night new inscriptions appeared,
testifying the sarcastic wit and the
vindictive sentiment of the parish.
And perhaps the Stocks themselves
were only spared from axe and bon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>fire
by the convenience they afforded
to the malice of the disaffected: they
became the Pasquin of Hazeldean.</p>

<p>As disaffection naturally produces
a correspondent vigour in authority,
so affairs had been lately administered
with greater severity than had been
hitherto wont in the easy rule of the
Squire and his predecessors. Suspected
persons were naturally marked
out by Mr Stirn, and reported to
his employer, who, too proud or too
pained to charge them openly with
ingratitude, at first only passed them
by in his walks with a silent and stiff
inclination of his head; and afterwards
gradually yielding to the baleful
influence of Stirn, the Squire
grumbled forth that "he did not see
why he should be always putting himself
out of his way to show kindness
to those who made such a return.
There ought to be a difference between
the good and the bad." Encouraged
by this admission, Stirn had conducted
himself towards the suspected parties,
and their whole kith and kin, with
the iron-banded justice that belonged
to his character. For some, habitual
donations of milk from the dairy, and
vegetables from the gardens, were
surlily suspended; others were informed
that their pigs were always
trespassing on the woods in search of
acorns; or that they were violating
the Game Laws in keeping lurchers.
A beer-house, popular in the neighbourhood,
but of late resorted to overmuch
by the grievance-mongers, (and
no wonder, since they had become
the popular party,) was threatened
with an application to the magistrates
for the withdrawal of its license.
Sundry old women, whose grandsons
were notoriously ill-disposed towards
the Stocks, were interdicted from gathering
dead sticks under the avenues,
on pretence that they broke down the
live boughs; and, what was more
obnoxious to the younger members of
the parish than most other retaliatory
measures, three chestnut trees, one
walnut, and two cherry trees, standing
at the bottom of the park, and
which had, from time immemorial,
been given up to the youth of Hazeldean,
were now solemnly placed under
the general defence of "private property."
And the crier had announced
that, henceforth, all depredators on the
fruit-trees in Copse Hollow would
be punished with the utmost rigour of
the law. Stirn, indeed, recommended
much more stringent proceedings than
all these indications of a change of
policy, which, he averred, would soon
bring the parish to its senses&mdash;such
as discontinuing many little jobs of
unprofitable work that employed the
surplus labour of the village. But
there the Squire, falling into the department,
and under the benigner influence
of his Harry, was as yet not
properly hardened. When it came to
a question that affected the absolute
quantity of loaves to be consumed by
the graceless mouths that fed upon
him, the milk of human kindness&mdash;with
which Providence has so bountifully
supplied that class of the mammalia
called the "Bucolic," and of
which our Squire had an extra "yield"&mdash;burst
forth, and washed away
all the indignation of the harsher
Adam.</p>

<p>Still your policy of half-measures,
which irritates without crushing its
victims, which flaps an exasperated
wasp-nest with a silk pocket-handkerchief,
instead of blowing it up
with a match and train, is rarely
successful; and, after three or four
other and much guiltier victims than
Lenny had been incarcerated in the
Stocks, the parish of Hazeldean was
ripe for any enormity. Pestilent
jacobinical tracts, conceived and composed
in the sinks of manufacturing
towns&mdash;found their way into the
popular beer-house&mdash;heaven knows
how, though the Tinker was suspected
of being the disseminator by all but
Stirn, who still, in a whisper, accused
the Papishers. And, finally, there
appeared amongst the other graphic
embellishments which the poor Stocks
had received, the rude <i>gravure</i> of a
gentleman in a broad-brimmed hat and
top-boots, suspended from a gibbet,
with the inscription beneath&mdash;"A
warnin to hall tirans&mdash;mind your hi!&mdash;sighnde
Captin sTraw."</p>

<p>It was upon this significant and
emblematic portraiture that the
Squire was gazing when the Parson
joined him.</p>

<p>"Well, Parson," said Mr Hazeldean
with a smile which he meant to
be pleasant and easy, but which
was exceedingly bitter and grim, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
wish you joy of your flock&mdash;you see
they have just hanged me in effigy!"</p>

<p>The Parson stared, and, though
greatly shocked, smothered his emotions;
and attempted, with the wisdom
of the serpent and the mildness
of the dove, to find another original
for the effigy.</p>

<p>"It is very bad," quoth he, "but
not so bad as all that, Squire; that's
not the shape of your hat. It is
evidently meant for Mr Stirn."</p>

<p>"Do you think so!" said the Squire
softened. "Yet the top-boots&mdash;Stirn
never wears top-boots."</p>

<p>"No more do you&mdash;except in hunting.
If you look again, those are not
tops&mdash;they are leggings&mdash;Stirn wears
leggings. Besides, that flourish, which
is meant for a nose, is a kind of a
hook like Stirn's; whereas your nose&mdash;though
by no means a snub&mdash;rather
turns up than not, as the Apollo's
does, according to the plaster cast
in Riccabocca's parlour."</p>

<p>"Poor Stirn!" said the Squire, in a
tone that evinced complacency, not
unmingled with compassion, "that's
what a man gets in this world by
being a faithful servant, and doing
his duty with zeal for his employer.
But you see that things have come to
a strange pass, and the question now
is, what course to pursue. The miscreants
hitherto have defied all
vigilance, and Stirn recommends the
employment of a regular night-watch
with a lanthorn and bludgeon."</p>

<p>"That may protect the Stocks
certainly; but will it keep those
detestable tracts out of the beer-house?"</p>

<p>"We shall shut the beer-house up
at the next sessions."</p>

<p>"The tracts will break out elsewhere&mdash;the
humour's in the blood!"</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to run off to
Brighton or Leamington&mdash;good hunting
at Leamington&mdash;for a year, just to
let the rogues see how they can get
on without me!"</p>

<p>The Squire's lip trembled.</p>

<p>"My dear Mr Hazeldean," said the
Parson, taking his friend's hand, "I
don't want to parade my superior
wisdom; but if you had taken my
advice, <i>quieta non movere</i>. Was there
ever a parish so peaceable as this, or
a country-gentleman so beloved as
you were, before you undertook the
task which has dethroned kings and
ruined states&mdash;that of wantonly
meddling with antiquity, whether for
the purpose of uncalled-for repairs
or the revival of obsolete uses."</p>

<p>At this rebuke, the Squire did not
manifest his constitutional tendencies
to choler; but he replied almost
meekly, "If it were to do again, faith, I
would leave the parish to the enjoyment
of the shabbiest pair of stocks
that ever disgraced a village. Certainly
I meant it for the best&mdash;an
ornament to the green; however,
now they are rebuilt, the Stocks must
be supported. Will Hazeldean is
not the man to give way to a set of
thankless rapscallions."</p>

<p>"I think," said the Parson, "that
you will allow that the House of Tudor,
whatever its faults, was a determined
resolute dynasty enough&mdash;high-hearted
and strong-headed. A Tudor would
never have fallen into the same calamities
as the poor Stuart did!"</p>

<p>"What the plague has the House
of Tudor got to do with my Stocks?"</p>

<p>"A great deal. Henry the VIII.
found a subsidy so unpopular that he
gave it up; and the people, in return,
allowed him to cut off as many heads
as he pleased, besides those in his
own family. Good Queen Bess, who,
I know, is your idol in history&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be sure!&mdash;she knighted my
ancestor at Tilbury Fort."</p>

<p>"Good Queen Bess struggled hard
to maintain a certain monopoly; she
saw it would not do, and she surrendered
it with that frank heartiness which
becomes a sovereign, and makes
surrender a grace."</p>

<p>"Ha! and you would have me
give up the Stocks?"</p>

<p>"I would much rather they had
stayed as they were, before you touched
them; but, as it is, if you could
find a good plausible pretext&mdash;and
there is an excellent one at hand;&mdash;the
sternest kings open prisons, and
grant favours, upon joyful occasions.
Now a marriage in the royal family is
of course a joyful occasion!&mdash;and so it
should be in that of the King of
Hazeldean." Admire that artful turn
in the Parson's eloquence!&mdash;it was
worthy of Riccabocca himself. Indeed,
Mr Dale had profited much by his
companionship with that Machiavellian
intellect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"A marriage&mdash;yes; but Frank has
only just got into long tails!"</p>

<p>"I did not allude to Frank, but to
your cousin Jemima!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p>The Squire staggered as if the
breath had been knocked out of him,
and, for want of a better seat, sate
down on the Stocks.</p>

<p>All the female heads in the neighbouring
cottages peered, themselves
unseen, through the casements. What
could the Squire be about?&mdash;what new
mischief did he meditate? Did he mean
to fortify the stocks? Old Gaffer
Solomons, who had an indefinite idea
of the lawful power of squires, and
who had been for the last ten minutes
at watch on his threshold, shook his
head and said&mdash;"Them as a cut out
the mon, a-hanging, as a put it in the
Squire's head!"</p>

<p>"Put what?" asked his granddaughter.</p>

<p>"The gallus!" answered Solomons&mdash;"he
be a-goin to have it hung from
the great elm-tree. And the Parson,
good mon, is a-quoting Scripter agin it&mdash;you
see he's a taking off his gloves,
and a putting his two han's togither,
as he do when he pray for the sick,
Jeany."</p>

<p>That description of the Parson's
mien and manner, which, with
his usual niceness of observation,
Gaffer Solomons thus sketched off,
will convey to you some idea of the
earnestness with which the Parson
pleaded the cause he had undertaken
to advocate. He dwelt much upon
the sense of propriety which the
foreigner had evinced in requesting
that the Squire might be consulted
before any formal communication to
his cousin; and he repeated Mrs
Dale's assurance, that such were Riccabocca's
high standard of honour
and belief in the sacred rights of
hospitality, that, if the Squire withheld
his consent to his proposals, the
Parson was convinced that the Italian
would instantly retract them. Now,
considering that Miss Hazeldean was,
to say the least, come to years of discretion,
and the Squire had long since
placed her property entirely at her own
disposal, Mr Hazeldean was forced
to acquiesce in the Parson's corollary
remark, "That this was a delicacy
which could not be expected from
every English pretender to the lady's
hand." Seeing that he had so far
cleared ground, the Parson went on
to intimate, though with great tact,
that, since Miss Jemima would probably
marry sooner or later, (and, indeed,
that the Squire could not wish to
prevent her,) it might be better for all
parties concerned that it should be with
some one who, though a foreigner,
was settled in the neighbourhood,
and of whose character what was
known was certainly favourable, than
run the hazard of her being married
for her money by some adventurer or
Irish fortune-hunter at the watering-places
she yearly visited. Then he
touched lightly on Riccabocca's agreeable
and companionable qualities;
and concluded with a skilful peroration
upon the excellent occasion the
wedding would afford to reconcile
Hall and parish, by making a voluntary
holocaust of the Stocks.</p>

<p>As he concluded, the Squire's brow,
before thoughtful, though not sullen,
cleared up benignly. To say truth,
the Squire was dying to get rid of the
Stocks, if he could but do so handsomely
and with dignity; and if all
the stars in the astrological horoscope
had conjoined together to give Miss
Jemima "assurance of a husband,"
they could not so have served her
with the Squire, as that conjunction
between the altar and the Stocks
which the Parson had effected!</p>

<p>Accordingly, when Mr Dale had
come to an end, the Squire replied
with great placidity and good sense,
"That Mr Rickeybockey had behaved
very much like a gentleman, and that
he was very much obliged to him; that
he (the Squire) had no right to interfere
in the matter, farther than with
his advice; that Jemima was old
enough to choose for herself, and that,
as the Parson had implied, after all
she might go farther and fare worse&mdash;indeed,
the farther she went, (that is,
the longer she waited,) the worse she
was likely to fare. I own for my
part," continued the Squire, "that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
though I like Rickeybockey very much,
I never suspected that Jemima was
caught with his long face; but there's
no accounting for tastes. My Harry,
indeed, was more shrewd, and gave
me many a hint, for which I only
laughed at her. Still I ought to have
thought it looked queer when Mounseer
took to disguising himself by
leaving off his glasses, ha&mdash;ha! I wonder
what Harry will say; let's go
and talk to her."</p>

<p>The Parson, rejoiced at this easy
way of taking the matter, hooked his
arm into the Squire's, and they walked
amicably towards the Hall. But on
coming first into the gardens they
found Mrs Hazeldean herself, clipping
dead leaves or fading flowers from her
rose-trees. The Squire stole slily
behind her, and startled her in her
turn by putting his arm round her
waist, and saluting her smooth cheek
with one of his hearty kisses; which,
by the way, from some association of
ideas, was a conjugal freedom that he
usually indulged whenever a wedding
was going on in the village.</p>

<p>"Fie, William!" said Mrs Hazeldean
coyly, and blushing as she saw
the Parson. "Well, who's going to
to be married now?"</p>

<p>"Lord, was there ever such a
woman?&mdash;she's guessed it!" cried the
Squire in great admiration. "Tell
her all about it, Parson."</p>

<p>The Parson obeyed.</p>

<p>Mrs Hazeldean, as the reader may
suppose, showed much less surprise
than her husband had done; but she
took the news graciously, and made
much the same answer as that which
had occurred to the Squire, only with
somewhat more qualification and reserve.
"Signor Riccabocca had behaved
very handsomely; and though
a daughter of the Hazeldeans of Hazeldean
might expect a much better
marriage in a worldly point of view,
yet as the lady in question had deferred
finding one so long, it would be
equally idle and impertinent now to
quarrel with her choice&mdash;if indeed she
should decide on accepting Signor
Riccabocca. As for fortune, that was
a consideration for the two contracting
parties. Still, it ought to be
pointed out to Miss Jemima that the
interest of her fortune would afford
but a very small income. That Dr
Riccabocca was a widower was another
matter for deliberation; and it
seemed rather suspicious that he
should have been hitherto so close
upon all matters connected with his
former life. Certainly his manners
were in his favour, and as long as he
was merely an acquaintance, and at
most a tenant, no one had a right to
institute inquiries of a strictly private
nature; but that, when he was about
to marry a Hazeldean of Hazeldean,
it became the Squire at least to know
a little more about him&mdash;who and
what he was. Why did he leave his
own country? English people went
abroad to save; no foreigner would
choose England as a country in which
to save money! She supposed that
a foreign doctor was no very great
things; probably he had been a professor
in some Italian university. At
all events, if the Squire interfered at
all, it was on such points that he
should request information."</p>

<p>"My dear madam," said the Parson,
"what you say is extremely just.
As to the causes which have induced
our friend to expatriate himself, I
think we need not look far for them.
He is evidently one of the many
Italian refugees whom political disturbances
have driven to our shore,
whose boast it is to receive all exiles
of whatever party. For his respectability
of birth and family he certainly
ought to obtain some vouchers. And
if that be the only objection, I trust
we may soon congratulate Miss Hazeldean
on a marriage with a man who,
though certainly very poor, has borne
privations without a murmur; has
preferred all hardship to debt; has
scorned to attempt betraying her into
any clandestine connection; who, in
short, has shown himself so upright
and honest, that I hope my dear
Mr Hazeldean will forgive him if he
is only a doctor&mdash;probably of Laws&mdash;and
not, as most foreigners pretend
to be, a marquis, or a baron at
least."</p>

<p>"As to that," cried the Squire,
"'tis the best thing I know about
Rickeybockey, that he don't attempt
to humbug us by any such foreign
trumpery. Thank heaven, the Hazeldeans
of Hazeldean were never tuft-hunters
and title-mongers; and if I
never ran after an English lord, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
should certainly be devilishly ashamed
of a brother-in-law whom I was
forced to call markee or count! I
should feel sure he was a courier,
or runaway valley-de-sham. Turn
up your nose at a doctor, indeed,
Harry!&mdash;pshaw, good English style
that! Doctor! my aunt married a
Doctor of Divinity&mdash;excellent man&mdash;wore
a wig, and was made a dean!
So long as Rickeybockey is not a doctor
of physic, I don't care a button.
If he's <i>that</i>, indeed, it would be suspicious;
because, you see, those foreign
doctors of physic are quacks, and tell
fortunes, and go about on a stage
with a Merry-Andrew."</p>

<p>"Lord, Hazeldean! where on earth
did you pick up that idea?" said Harry
laughing.</p>

<p>"Pick it up!&mdash;why I saw a fellow
myself at the cattle fair last year&mdash;when
I was buying short-horns&mdash;with
a red waistcoat and a cocked hat, a
little like the Parson's shovel. He
called himself Doctor Phoscophornio&mdash;wore
a white wig, and sold pills!
The Merry-Andrew was the funniest
creature&mdash;in salmon-coloured tights&mdash;turned
head over heels, and said he
came from Timbuctoo. No, no; if
Rickeybockey's a physic Doctor, we
shall have Jemima in a pink tinsel
dress, tramping about the country in
a caravan!"</p>

<p>At this notion, both the Squire and
his wife laughed so heartily that the
Parson felt the thing was settled, and
slipped away, with the intention of
making his report to Riccabocca.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<p>It was with a slight disturbance of
his ordinary suave and well-bred
equanimity that the Italian received
the information, that he need apprehend
no obstacle to his suit from the
insular prejudices or the worldly views
of the lady's family. Not that he was
mean and cowardly enough to recoil
from the near and unclouded prospect
of that felicity which he had left
off his glasses to behold with unblinking
naked eyes:&mdash;no, there his mind
was made up; but he had met with
very little kindness in life, and he was
touched not only by the interest in
his welfare testified by a heretical
priest, but by the generosity with
which he was admitted into a well-born
and wealthy family, despite his
notorious poverty and his foreign
descent. He conceded the propriety
of the only stipulation, which was
conveyed to him by the Parson with
all the delicacy that became a man
professionally habituated to deal with
the subtler susceptibilities of mankind&mdash;viz.,
that, amongst Riccabocca's
friends or kindred, some one should be
found whose report would confirm the
persuasion of his respectability entertained
by his neighbours;&mdash;he assented,
I say, to the propriety of this
condition; but it was not with alacrity
and eagerness. His brow became
clouded. The Parson hastened to
assure him that the Squire was not a
man <i>qui stupet in titulis</i>, (who was
besotted with titles,) that he neither
expected nor desired to find an origin
and rank for his brother-in-law above
that decent mediocrity of condition to
which it was evident, from Riccabocca's
breeding and accomplishments, he
could easily establish his claim. "And
though," said he smiling, "the Squire
is a warm politician in his own
country, and would never see his
sister again, I fear, if she married
some convicted enemy of our happy
constitution, yet for foreign politics
he does not care a straw; so that if,
as I suspect, your exile arises from
some quarrel with your Government&mdash;which,
being foreign, he takes for
granted must be insupportable&mdash;he
would but consider you as he would
a Saxon who fled from the iron hand
of William the Conqueror, or a
Lancastrian expelled by the Yorkists
in our Wars of the Roses."</p>

<p>The Italian smiled. "Mr Hazeldean
shall be satisfied," said he simply.
"I see, by the Squire's newspaper,
that an English gentleman who knew
me in my own country has just
arrived in London. I will write to
him for a testimonial, at least to my
probity and character. Probably he
may be known to you by name&mdash;nay,
he must be, for he was a distinguished
officer in the late war. I allude to
Lord L'Estrange."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>The Parson started.</p>

<p>"You know Lord L'Estrange?&mdash;a
profligate bad man, I fear."</p>

<p>"Profligate!&mdash;bad!" exclaimed
Riccabocca. "Well, calumnious as
the world is, I should never have
thought that such expressions would
be applied to one who, though I
knew him but little&mdash;knew him chiefly
by the service he once rendered to
me&mdash;first taught me to love and
revere the English name!"</p>

<p>"He may be changed since&mdash;" The
parson paused.</p>

<p>"Since when?" asked Riccabocca,
with evident curiosity.</p>

<p>Mr Dale seemed embarrassed. "Excuse
me," said he, "it is many years
ago; and, in short, the opinion I then
formed of the gentleman in question
was based upon circumstances which
I cannot communicate."</p>

<p>The punctilious Italian bowed in
silence, but he still looked as if he
should have liked to prosecute inquiry.</p>

<p>After a pause, he said, "Whatever
your impressions respecting Lord
L'Estrange, there is nothing, I suppose,
which would lead you to doubt
his honour, or reject his testimonial
in my favour?"</p>

<p>"According to fashionable morality,"
said Mr Dale, rather precisely, "I
know of nothing that could induce me
to suppose that Lord L'Estrange
would not, in this instance, speak the
truth. And he has unquestionably a
high reputation as a soldier, and a
considerable position in the world."
Therewith the Parson took his leave.
A few days afterwards, Dr Riccabocca
enclosed to the Squire, in a blank envelope,
a letter he had received from
Harley L'Estrange. It was evidently
intended for the Squire's eye,
and to serve as a voucher for the
Italian's respectability; but this object
was fulfilled, not in the coarse
form of a direct testimonial, but with
a tact and delicacy which seemed to
show more than the fine breeding to
be expected from one in Lord L'Estrange's
station. It argued that
most exquisite of all politeness which
comes from the heart: a certain tone
of affectionate respect (which even
the homely sense of the Squire felt,
intuitively, proved far more in favour
of Riccabocca than the most elaborate
certificate of his qualities and antecedents)
pervaded the whole, and would
have sufficed in itself to remove all
scruples from a mind much more suspicious
and exacting than that of the
Squire of Hazeldean. But, lo and
behold! an obstacle now occurred to
the Parson, of which he ought to have
thought long before&mdash;viz., the Papistical
religion of the Italian. Dr
Riccabocca was professedly a Roman
Catholic. He so little obtruded that
fact&mdash;and, indeed, had assented so
readily to any animadversions upon
the superstition and priestcraft which,
according to Protestants, are the
essential characteristics of Papistical
communities&mdash;that it was not till the
hymeneal torch, which brings all
faults to light, was fairly illumined
for the altar, that the remembrance of
a faith so cast into the shade burst
upon the conscience of the Parson.
The first idea that then occurred to
him was the proper and professional
one&mdash;viz., the conversion of Dr Riccabocca.
He hastened to his study,
took down from his shelves long neglected
volumes of controversial divinity,
armed himself with an arsenal
of authorities, arguments, and texts;
then, seizing the shovel-hat, posted
off to the Casino.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p>The Parson burst upon the philosopher
like an avalanche! He was
so full of his subject that he could not
let it out in prudent driblets. No, he
went souse upon the astounded Riccabocca&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Tremendo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jupiter ipse ruens tumultu."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sage&mdash;shrinking deeper into
his arm-chair, and drawing his dressing-robe
more closely round him&mdash;suffered
the Parson to talk for three
quarters of an hour, till indeed he had
thoroughly proved his case; and, like
Brutus, "paused for a reply."</p>

<p>Then said Riccabocca mildly, "In
much of what you have urged so
ably, and so suddenly, I am inclined
to agree. But base is the man who
formally forswears the creed he has
inherited from his fathers, and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>fessed
since the cradle up to years of
maturity, when the change presents
itself in the guise of a bribe;&mdash;when,
for such is human nature, he can
hardly distinguish or disentangle the
appeal to his reason from the lure to
his interests&mdash;here a text, and there
a dowry!&mdash;here Protestantism, there
Jemima! Own, my friend, that the
soberest casuist would see double
under the inebriating effects produced
by so mixing his polemical liquors.
Appeal, my good Mr Dale, from
Philip drunken to Philip sober!&mdash;from
Riccabocca intoxicated with the assurance
of your excellent lady, that he
is about to be "the happiest of men,"
to Riccabocca accustomed to his happiness,
and carrying it off with the
seasoned equability of one grown
familiar with stimulants&mdash;in a word,
appeal from Riccabocca the wooer to
Riccabocca the spouse. I may be
convertible, but conversion is a slow
process; courtship should be a quick
one&mdash;ask Miss Jemima. <i>Finalmente</i>,
marry me first, and convert me afterwards!"</p>

<p>"You take this too jestingly,"
began the Parson; "and I don't
see why, with your excellent understanding,
truths so plain and obvious
should not strike you at
once."</p>

<p>"Truths," interrupted Riccabocca
profoundly, "are the slowest growing
things in the world! It took 1500
years from the date of the Christian
era to produce your own Luther, and
then he flung his Bible at Satan, (I
have seen the mark made by the book
on the wall of his prison in Germany,)
besides running off with a nun,
which no Protestant clergyman would
think it proper and right to do now-a-days."
Then he added, with seriousness,
"Look you, my dear sir,&mdash;I
should lose my own esteem if I were
even to listen to you now with
becoming attention,&mdash;now, I say,
when you hint that the creed I have
professed may be in the way of my
advantage. If so, I must keep the
creed and resign the advantage. But
if, as I trust&mdash;not only as a Christian,
but a man of honour&mdash;you will defer
this discussion, I will promise to listen
to you hereafter; and though, to
say truth, I believe that you will not
convert me, I will promise you faithfully
never to interfere with my wife's
religion."</p>

<p>"And any children you may have?"</p>

<p>"Children!" said Dr Riccabocca,
recoiling&mdash;"you are not contented
with firing your pocket-pistol right in
my face; you must also pepper me all
over with small-shot. Children!
well, if they are girls, let them follow
the faith of their mother; and if boys,
while in childhood, let them be contented
with learning to be Christians;
and when they grow into men, let
them choose for themselves which is
the best form for the practice of the
great principles which all sects have
in common."</p>

<p>"But," began Mr Dale again,
pulling a large book from his pocket.</p>

<p>Dr Riccabocca flung open the window,
and jumped out of it.</p>

<p>It was the rapidest and most dastardly
flight you could possibly conceive;
but it was a great compliment
to the argumentative powers of
the Parson, and he felt it as such.
Nevertheless, Mr Dale thought it
right to have a long conversation, both
with the Squire and Miss Jemima
herself, upon the subject which his
intended convert had so ignominiously
escaped.</p>

<p>The Squire, though a great foe to
Popery, politically considered, had
also quite as great a hatred to turn-coats
and apostates. And in his
heart he would have despised Riccabocca
if he could have thrown off his
religion as easily as he had done his
spectacles. Therefore he said simply&mdash;"Well,
it is certainly a great pity
that Rickeybockey is not of the
Church of England, though, I take it,
that would be unreasonable to expect
in a man born and bred under the
nose of the Inquisition," (the Squire
firmly believed that the Inquisition
was in full force in all the Italian
states, with whips, racks, and thumbscrews;
and, indeed, his chief information
of Italy was gathered from a perusal
he had given in early youth to
<i>The One-Handed Monk</i>;) "but I think
he speaks very fairly, on the whole,
as to his wife and children. And the
thing's gone too far now to retract.
It is all your fault for not thinking of
it before; and I've now just made up
my mind as to the course to pursue
respecting those&mdash;d&mdash;d Stocks!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Miss Jemima, the Parson
left her with a pious thanksgiving
that Riccabocca at least was a Christian,
and not a Pagan, Mahometan, or Jew.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>

<p>There is that in a wedding which
appeals to a universal sympathy.
No other event in the lives of their
superiors in rank creates an equal sensation
amongst the humbler classes.</p>

<p>From the moment the news had
spread throughout the village that
Miss Jemima was to be married, all
the old affection for the Squire and his
House burst forth the stronger for its
temporary suspension. Who could
think of the Stocks in such a season?
They were swept out of fashion&mdash;hunted
from remembrance as completely
as the question of Repeal or
the thought of Rebellion from the
warm Irish heart, when the fair young
face of the Royal Wife beamed on
the sister isle.</p>

<p>Again cordial curtseys were dropped
at the thresholds by which the
Squire passed to his home farm; again
the sun-burnt brows uncovered&mdash;no
more with sullen ceremony&mdash;were
smoothed into cheerful gladness at
his nod. Nay, the little ones began
again to assemble at their ancient
rendezvous by the Stocks, as if either
familiarised with the Phenomenon, or
convinced that, in the general sentiment
of good-will, its powers of evil
were annulled.</p>

<p>The Squire tasted once more the
sweets of the only popularity which
is much worth having, and the loss
of which a wise man would reasonably
deplore; viz., the popularity
which arises from a persuasion of our
goodness, and a reluctance to recall
our faults. Like all blessings, the
more sensibly felt from previous interruption,
the Squire enjoyed this
restored popularity with an exhilarated
sense of existence; his stout
heart beat more vigorously; his stalwart
step trod more lightly; his comely
English face looked comelier and
more English than ever;&mdash;you would
have been a merrier man for a week
to have come within hearing of his
jovial laugh.</p>

<p>He felt grateful to Jemima and to
Riccabocca as the special agents of
Providence in this general <i>integratio
amoris</i>. To have looked at him, you
would suppose that it was the Squire
who was going to be married a second
time to his Harry!</p>

<p>One may well conceive that such
would have been an inauspicious
moment for Parson Dale's theological
scruples. To have stopped that marriage&mdash;chilled
all the sunshine it diffused
over the village&mdash;seen himself
surrounded again by long sulky visages,&mdash;I
verily believe, though a better
friend of Church and State never
stood on a hustings, that, rather than
court such a revulsion, the Squire
would have found jesuitical excuses
for the marriage if Riccabocca had
been discovered to be the Pope in disguise!
As for the Stocks, their fate
was now irrevocably sealed. In
short, the marriage was concluded&mdash;first
privately, according to the bridegroom's
creed, by a Roman Catholic
clergyman, who lived in a town some
miles off, and next publicly in the village
church of Hazeldean.</p>

<p>It was the heartiest rural wedding!
Village girls strewed flowers on the
way;&mdash;a booth was placed amidst the
prettiest scenery of the Park, on the
margin of the lake&mdash;for there was to
be a dance later in the day;&mdash;an ox was
roasted whole. Even Mr Stirn&mdash;no,
Mr Stirn was <i>not</i> present, so much happiness
would have been the death of
him! And the Papisher too, who had
conjured Lenny out of the Stocks;
nay, who had himself sate in the
Stocks for the very purpose of bringing
them into contempt&mdash;the Papisher!
he had as lief Miss Jemima had married
the devil! Indeed he was persuaded
that, in point of fact, it was
all one and the same. Therefore Mr
Stirn had asked leave to go and attend
his uncle the pawnbroker, about
to undergo a torturing operation for
the stone! Frank was there, summoned
from Eton for the occasion&mdash;having
grown two inches taller since
he left&mdash;for the one inch of which
nature was to be thanked, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
other a new pair of resplendent Wellingtons.
But the boy's joy was less
apparent than that of others. For
Jemima was a special favourite with
him, as she would have, been with all
boys&mdash;for she was always kind and
gentle, and made many pretty presents
whenever she came from the
watering-places. And Frank knew
that he should miss her sadly, and
thought she had made a very queer
choice.</p>

<p>Captain Higginbotham had been
invited; but, to the astonishment of
Jemima, he had replied to the invitation
by a letter to herself, marked
"<i>private and confidential</i>." 'She
must have long known,' said the
letter, 'of his devoted attachment to
her; motives of delicacy, arising
from the narrowness of his income,
and the magnanimity of his sentiments,
had alone prevented his formal
proposals; but now that she was informed
(he could scarcely believe his
senses, or command his passions) that
her relations wished to force her
into a <span class="smcap">BARBAROUS</span> marriage with a
foreigner Of <span class="smcap">MOST FORBIDDING APPEARANCE</span>,
and most <i>abject circumstances</i>,
he lost not a moment in laying
at her feet his own hand and
fortune. And he did this the more confidently,
inasmuch as he could not but
be aware of Miss Jemima's <span class="smcap">SECRET</span>
feelings towards him, while he was
<i>proud</i> and <i>happy</i> to say, that his dear
and distinguished cousin, Mr Sharpe
Currie, had honoured him with a
warmth of regard, which justified the
most <i>brilliant</i> <span class="smcap">EXPECTATIONS</span>&mdash;likely
to be <i>soon</i> realised&mdash;as his eminent
relative had contracted a <i>very bad liver
complaint</i> in the service of his country,
and could not last long!'.</p>

<p>In all the years they had known each
other, Miss Jemima, strange as it may
appear, had never once suspected the
Captain of any other feelings to her
than those of a brother. To say that
she was not gratified by learning her
mistake, would be to say that she
was more than woman. Indeed, it
must have been a source of no ignoble
triumph to think that she could prove
her disinterested affection to her dear
Riccabocca, by a prompt rejection
of this more brilliant offer. She
couched the rejection, it is true, in the
most soothing terms. But the Captain
evidently considered himself ill
used; he did not reply to the letter,
and did not come to the wedding.</p>

<p>To let the reader into a secret,
never known to Miss Jemima, Captain
Higginbotham was much less influenced
by Cupid than by Plutus in
the offer he had made. The Captain
was one of that class of gentlemen
who read their accounts by those
corpse-lights, or will-o'-the-wisps,
called <i>expectations</i>. Ever since the
Squire's grandfather had left him&mdash;then
in short clothes&mdash;a legacy of
&pound;500, the Captain had peopled the
future with expectations! He talked
of his expectations as a man talks of
shares in a Tontine; they might
fluctuate a little&mdash;be now up and now
down&mdash;but it was morally impossible,
if he lived on, but that he should be a
<i>millionnaire</i> one of these days. Now,
though Miss Jemima was a good
fifteen years younger than himself,
yet she always stood for a good round
sum in the ghostly books of the Captain.
She was an <i>expectation</i> to the
full amount of her &pound;4000, seeing that
Frank was an only child, and it would
be carrying coals to Newmarket to
leave <i>him</i> anything.</p>

<p>Rather than see so considerable a
cipher suddenly spunged out of his
visionary ledger&mdash;rather than so much
money should vanish clean out of the
family, Captain Higginbotham had
taken what he conceived, if a desperate,
at least a certain, step for the
preservation of his property. If the
golden horn could not be had without
the heifer, why, he must take the
heifer into the bargain. He had
never formed to himself an idea that
a heifer so gentle would toss and fling
him over. The blow was stunning.
But no one compassionates the misfortunes
of the covetous, though
few perhaps are in greater need of
compassion. And leaving poor Captain
Higginbotham to retrieve his illusory
fortunes as he best may among
'the expectations' which gathered
round the form of Mr Sharpe
Currie, who was the crossest old tyrant
imaginable, and never allowed at his
table any dishes not compounded with
rice, which played Old Nick with the
Captain's constitutional functions,&mdash;I
return to the wedding at Hazeldean,
just in time to see the bridegroom&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>who
looked singularly well on the
occasion&mdash;hand the bride (who, between
sunshiny tears and affectionate
smiles, was really a very interesting
and even a pretty bride, as brides go)
into a carriage which the Squire had
presented to them, and depart on the
orthodox nuptial excursion amidst
the blessings of the assembled crowd.</p>

<p>It may be thought strange by the
unreflective that these rural spectators
should so have approved and blessed
the marriage of a Hazeldean of Hazeldean
with a poor, outlandish, long-haired
foreigner; but, besides that
Riccabocca, after all, had become one
of the neighbourhood, and was proverbially
"a civil-spoken gentleman," it
is generally noticeable that on wedding
occasions the bride so monopolises
interest, curiosity, and admiration,
that the bridegroom himself goes
for little or nothing. He is merely
the passive agent in the affair&mdash;the
unregarded cause of the general satisfaction.
It was not Riccabocca himself
that they approved and blessed&mdash;it
was the gentleman in the white
waistcoat who had made Miss Jemima&mdash;Madam
Rickeybockey!</p>

<p>Leaning on his wife's arm, (for it
was a habit of the Squire to lean on
his wife's arm rather than she on his,
when he was specially pleased; and
there was something touching in
the sight of that strong sturdy frame
thus insensibly, in hours of happiness,
seeking dependence on the frail arm
of woman,)&mdash;leaning, I say, on his
wife's arm, the Squire, about the hour
of sunset, walked down to the booth
by the lake.</p>

<p>All the parish&mdash;young and old,
man, woman, and child&mdash;were assembled
there, and their faces seemed to
bear one family likeness, in the common
emotion which animated all, as
they turned to his frank fatherly
smile. Squire Hazeldean stood at
the head of the long table: he filled a
horn with ale from the brimming tankard
beside him. Then he looked
round, and lifted his hand to request
silence; and, ascending the chair,
rose in full view of all. Every one
felt that the Squire was about to make
a speech, and the earnestness of the
attention was proportioned to the
rarity of the event; for (though he
was not unpractised in the oratory of
the hustings) only thrice before had
the Squire made what could fairly be
called "a speech" to the villagers
of Hazeldean&mdash;once on a kindred festive
occasion, when he had presented
to them his bride&mdash;once in a contested
election for the shire, in which he
took more than ordinary interest, and
was not quite so sober as he ought to
have been&mdash;once in a time of great
agricultural distress, when, in spite of
reduction of rents, the farmers had
been compelled to discard a large
number of their customary labourers;
and when the Squire had said,&mdash;"I
have given up keeping the hounds, because
I want to make a fine piece of
water, (that was the origin of the
lake,) and to drain all the low lands
round the park. Let every man who
wants work come to me!" And that
sad year the parish rates of Hazeldean
were not a penny the more.</p>

<p>Now, for the fourth time, the Squire
rose, and thus he spoke. At his
right hand, Harry; at his left, Frank.
At the bottom of the table, as vice-president,
Parson Dale, his little wife
behind him, only obscurely seen. She
cried readily, and her handkerchief
was already before her eyes.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

THE SQUIRE'S SPEECH.</h3>

<p>"Friends and neighbours,&mdash;I thank
you kindly for coming round me this
day, and for showing so much interest
in me and mine. My cousin was
not born amongst you as I was, but
you have known her from a child. It
is a familiar face, and one that never
frowned, which you will miss at your
cottage doors, as I and mine will miss
it long in the old hall&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here there was a sob from some of
the women, and nothing was seen of
Mrs Dale but the white handkerchief.
The Squire himself paused, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
brushed away a tear with the back
of his hand. Then he resumed, with
a sudden change of voice that was
electrical&mdash;</p>

<p>"For we none of us prize a blessing
till we have lost it! Now,
friends and neighbours,&mdash;a little time
ago, it seemed as if some ill-will had
crept into the village&mdash;ill-will between
you and me, neighbours!&mdash;why, that
is not like Hazeldean!"</p>

<p>The audience hung their heads!
You never saw people look so
thoroughly ashamed of themselves.
The Squire proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't say it was all your fault;
perhaps it was mine."</p>

<p>"Noa&mdash;noa&mdash;noa," burst forth in a
general chorus.</p>

<p>"Nay, friends," continued the
Squire humbly, and in one of those
illustrative aphorisms which, if less
subtle than Riccabocca's, were more
within reach of the popular comprehension;
"nay&mdash;we are all human;
and every man has his hobby: sometimes
he breaks in the hobby, and
sometimes the hobby, if it is very
hard in the mouth, breaks in him.
One man's hobby has an ill habit of
always stopping at the public house!
(Laughter.) Another man's hobby
refuses to stir a peg beyond the door
where some buxom lass patted its
neck the week before&mdash;a hobby I
rode pretty often when I went courting
my good wife here! (Much
laughter and applause.) Others have
a lazy hobby, that there's no getting
on;&mdash;others, a runaway hobby that
there's no stopping: but to cut the
matter short, my favourite hobby, as
you well know, is always trotted out
to any place on my property which
seems to want the eye and hand of
the master. I hate (cried the Squire
warming) to see things neglected and
decayed, and going to the dogs! This
land we live in is a good mother to
us, and we can't do too much for her.
It is very true, neighbours, that I owe
her a good many acres, and ought to
speak well of her; but what then? I
live amongst you, and what I take
from the rent with one hand, I divide
amongst you with the other, (low,
but assenting murmurs.) Now the
more I improve my property, the
more mouths it feeds. My great-grandfather
kept a Field-Book, in
which were entered, not only the
names of all the farmers and the
quantity of land they held, but the
average number of the labourers each
employed. My grandfather and father
followed his example: I have done
the same. I find, neighbours, that
our rents have doubled since my
great-grandfather began to make the
book. Ay&mdash;but there are more
than four times the number of
labourers employed on the estate,
and at much better wages too! Well,
my men, that says a great deal in favour
of improving property, and not
letting it go to the dogs. (Applause.)
And therefore, neighbours, you will
kindly excuse my hobby: it carries
grist to your mill. (Reiterated applause.)
Well&mdash;but you will say,
'What's the Squire driving at?'
Why this, my friends: There was
only one worn-out, dilapidated, tumble-down
thing in the Parish of Hazeldean,
and it became an eyesore to
me; so I saddled my hobby, and rode
at it. O ho! you know what I mean
now! Yes, but neighbours, you need
not have taken it so to heart. That
was a scurvy trick of some of you to
hang me in effigy, as they call it."</p>

<p>"It warn't you," cried a voice in
the crowd, "it war Nick Stirn."</p>

<p>The Squire recognised the voice of
the tinker; but though he now guessed
at the ringleader,&mdash;on that day of
general amnesty, he had the prudence
and magnanimity not to say,
"Stand forth, Sprott: thou art the
man." Yet his gallant English spirit
would not suffer him to come off at
the expense of his servant.</p>

<p>"If it was Nick Stirn you meant,"
said he gravely, "more shame for
you. It showed some pluck to hang
the master; but to hang the poor servant,
who only thought to do his
duty, careless of what ill-will it
brought upon him, was a shabby
trick&mdash;so little like the lads of Hazeldean,
that I suspect the man who
taught it to them was never born in
the parish. But let bygones be bygones.
One thing is clear, you don't
take kindly to my new Pair of Stocks!
They have been a stumbling-block
and a grievance, and there's no denying
that we went on very pleasantly
without them. I may also say that
in spite of them we have been coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
together again lately. And I can't
tell you what good it did me to see
your children playing again on the
green, and your honest faces, in spite
of the Stocks, and those diabolical
tracts you've been reading lately,
lighted up at the thought that something
pleasant was going on at the
Hall. Do you know, neighbours,
you put me in mind of an old story
which, besides applying to the Parish,
all who are married, and all who intend
to marry, will do well to recollect.
A worthy couple, named John and
Joan, had lived happily together many
a long year, till one unlucky day they
bought a new bolster. Joan said the
bolster was too hard, and John that
it was too soft. So, of course, they
quarrelled. After sulking all day,
they agreed to put the bolster between
them at night." (Roars of laughter
amongst the men; the women did not
know which way to look, except,
indeed, Mrs Hazeldean, who, though
she was more than usually rosy,
maintained her innocent genial smile,
as much as to say, "There is no
harm in the Squire's jests.") The
orator resumed&mdash;"After they had
thus lain apart for a little time, very
silent and sullen, John sneezed. 'God
bless you!' says Joan over the bolster.
'Did you say God bless me?'
cries John;&mdash;'then here goes the
bolster!'"</p>

<p>Prolonged laughter and tumultuous
applause.</p>

<p>"Friends and neighbours," said the
Squire when silence was restored, and
lifting the horn of ale, "I have the
pleasure to inform you that I have
ordered the Stocks to be taken down,
and made into a bench for the chimney
nook of our old friend Gaffer Solomons
yonder. But mind me, lads,
if ever you make the Parish regret
the loss of the Stocks, and the
overseers come to me with long faces
and say, 'the Stocks must be rebuilded,'
why&mdash;" Here from all the
youth of the village rose so deprecating
a clamour, that the Squire
would have been the most bungling
orator in the world if he had said
a word further on the subject. He
elevated the horn over his head&mdash;"Why,
that's my old Hazeldean
again! Health and long life to you
all!"</p>

<p>The Tinker had sneaked out of the
assembly, and did not show his face
in the village for the next six months.
And as to those poisonous tracts, in
spite of their salubrious labels, "the
Poor Man's Friend," or "the Rights
of Labour," you could no more have
found one of them lurking in the
drawers of the kitchen-dressers in
Hazeldean, than you would have
found the deadly nightshade on the
flower-stands in the drawing-room of
the Hall. As for the revolutionary
beer-house, there was no need to
apply to the magistrates to shut it up;
it shut itself up before the week was
out.</p>

<p>O young head of the great House
of Hapsburg, what a Hazeldean you
might have made of Hungary!&mdash;What
a "<i>Moriamur pro rege nostro</i>"
would have rang in your infant reign,&mdash;if
you had made such a speech as
the Squire's!</p>

<h2>ADDITIONAL CHAPTERS FROM THE HISTORY OF JOHN BULL.&mdash;PART II.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

HOW MARTIN'S SON, AUGUSTINE, BEGAN TO IMITATE HIS UNCLE PETER.</h3>

<p>It is now my duty, in a few words,
to make you acquainted with the state
of Martin's family. Martin, as you
know, had acted as chaplain to Squire
Bull ever since Peter was sent about
his business, with the exception of the
short period during which red-nosed
Noll the brewer held forcible possession
of the Squire's house. Noll had
a mortal hatred to Martin, (who, it
must be allowed, reciprocated the
sentiment with extreme cordiality,)
and wanted to dispossess him for ever
of his benefice and vicarage, in favour
of any drunken serjeant who had a
taste for theology and ale. However,
when the Squire came back to his own
estate, Martin returned with him, and
has remained chaplain up to the present
day without any hindrance or
molestation. At times some of the
household have grumbled because
Martin has a place at the upper servants'
table; but the complaint was
never made by any except such pestilent
rogues as wished in their
hearts to see the Squire deprived of
his lawful authority, and the whole of
Bullockshatch thrown into a state of
anarchy and confusion.</p>

<p>Martin was as excellent a man as
ever stepped upon neat's leather. He
did his duty to the poor honourably
and conscientiously, kept his church
in good repair, looked after the parish
schools, and was, in short, a comfort
and a credit to all who knew him. He
was also a married man, a circumstance
whereof Peter tried to make
the most; abusing him, forsooth, because
he did not follow his own
example of getting the girls into a
corner to tell him about their little
indiscretions and secret thoughts&mdash;a
pastime to which that hoary old sinner
was especially addicted;&mdash;or of worming
himself into some private gentleman's
family, and then frightening
the lady of the house into fits by
threatening to put her into a brick-kiln
or red-hot oven, of which Peter
pretended to keep the key, if she did
not divulge to him the whole of her
husband's secrets, and hand over the
children in private to be stamped with
Peter's mark. Many a once happy
household had the old villain brought
to misery by those scandalous intrigues;
for the truth is, that he stuck
at nothing which might tend to his
own advancement, however infamous
were the means. Had Martin been
a reprobate like himself, he might possibly
have endured him: as it was, his
good character and decent habits were
so many arguments for Peter to abuse
him wherever he went.</p>

<p>Martin had a son, who in due time
was appointed his curate, and had a
chapel to himself. This young, man,
whose name was Augustine, was by
no means so discreet a person as his
father. He was of a moping and melancholy
habit, very much addicted to
the study of architecture, which he
carried to such an excess that you
could not be five minutes in his company
without hearing him discourse
about mullions, brackets, architraves,
and flying buttresses, in a way that
would have bewildered a stone mason.
He got his chapel fitted up in such a
style that it exactly resembled one of
Peter's; and this he did, as he openly
avowed, from a regard to the customs
of antiquity. When Martin was told
of this, he shook his head, caught up
his walking cane, and stepped over to
the chapel, where he found Augustine
superintending the erection of a new
oriel window, the design of which
was gorgeous enough to eclipse the
glories of the most brilliant butterfly
of Brazil.</p>

<p>"What's here to do?" quoth Martin,
walking up the chancel. "Mighty
handsome this, son Augustine, to be
sure; but&mdash;don't it strike you that the
effect is a little too Peterish? Mind,
I do not object in the least to your
making the chapel neat and tidy. I
never thought, as brother Jack used
to do, (though he is now becoming
more sensible on those points,) that a
church ought as nearly as possible to
resemble a barn. On the contrary, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
like to see everything in its proper
place. But what's this?" continued
he, tapping with his cane a kind of
ornamented basin with a slab. "I
don't remember ever having seen any
thing of this kind before."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir!" replied Augustine;
"you surprise me very much. I
thought everyone must be acquainted
with the Piscina and Finistella. Those,
I can assure you, are accurate copies
from ancient drawings of the church
of Saint Ethelred, which was burned
by the Danes about the beginning of
the tenth century."</p>

<p>"That may be," quoth Martin,
"but I can't for the life of me see the
use of them now. And what may
you call this?"</p>

<p>"That, sir? Why, that's the credence
table. There is a splendid specimen
of that style of architecture in
the cathedral remains of St Ninian."</p>

<p>"And that carved wood-work up
there near the gallery?"</p>

<p>"That, sir, is the rood-loft, constructed
on medi&aelig;val principles, after
the designs of Hubert the Confessor."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, son Augustine,"
said Martin, "all this is very
pretty; and if you and your people
wish to have it, there may be no positive
reason why I should interfere.
Thank heaven, sound doctrine does not
depend upon stone and lime; and so
long as your principles are firm, it
may not matter much that you are a
little absurd or so about this architectural
hobby of yours. But, mark me
well, my dear boy," continued the good
gentleman, with tears in his eyes;
"no trafficking or colleaguing with
Peter! That old miscreant has ever
been a bitter enemy of me and mine, and
of the Squire to boot; and if it should
come to pass that my own flesh and
blood were to desert me for that impious
rascal, I would be fain to carry
my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave!
Think well of this, I beseech you, and
on no account whatever have anything
to say to that arch-deceiver!"</p>

<p>You might reasonably suppose that
Augustine was much moved by this
remonstrance. Not a whit of it. He
was much too conceited to take counsel
from any one; and in his secret
heart began to look upon his father
as no better than an uncharitable
bigot.</p>

<p>"Holy Saint Pancras!" he would
say, for he had a queer habit of invoking
the names of dead people, "what
can it matter to any one whether I
bow to my uncle Peter or not? People
tell me I am rather like him in complexion;
and I daresay, after all, there
is a strong family resemblance. What
have I to do with old family feuds,
which had far better be forgotten?
As to the nine-and-thirty points of
doctrine to which I have set my name,
some of them may be good, and others
heterodox; but I presume I am not
compelled to accept them in the literal
sense. Why should they be made a
stumbling-block in the way of a proper
reconciliation between myself and my
uncle, who no doubt has fallen into
questionable practices, though in the
main he is quite as like to be right as
my father Martin?"</p>

<p>Augustine, however, did not venture
to hold this kind of talk openly
for some time, knowing that, if it came
to the ears of Martin, he would inevitably
be disinherited on the spot, and
turned out of his cure. In the discourses
which he delivered from the
pulpit, he was wont to express great
sorrow and anxiety for the backslidings
of his "venerable relative," as he
now termed Peter, "towards whom
his bowels yearned with an almost
unspeakable affection. It would ill
become him to forget what Peter had
done for the family long ago, and
indeed for the whole of Bullockshatch;
and although he was now, no
doubt, cast out for his sins, he, Augustine,
could not prevail upon himself
to speak harshly of a gentleman who
had such excellent grounds for styling
himself the head of the whole house."
Then he would go on to insinuate that
there were two sides to every question&mdash;that
his own father Martin might
possibly have behaved more roughly
to Peter than there was any occasion
for&mdash;and that Peter had many
good points about him for which he
did not receive sufficient credit. Having
thus talked over his congregation,
who were willing enough to go along
with him a certain length, he began in
public to wear a dress as nearly approaching
to that of Peter's retainers
as he durst. He turned his back upon
people, just as the others did, and
dressed up the charity-boys in white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
gowns, to look, as he said, like
acolytes. One, winter's morning,
when the parishioners arrived at
church, they were petrified at seeing
two huge candlesticks placed upon
the table, such articles of furniture
having been for a long time disused
in the churches throughout Bullockshatch.
Augustine, however, had discovered
from some old musty pamphlet
that they were not strictly forbidden;
so he got a pair of new ones made,
(after the medi&aelig;val fashion, of course,)
and preached a long sermon for the
purpose of demonstrating their advantages
and mystical meaning. Three
Sundays afterwards, the weather being
rather dark and hazy, they were fitted
with lighted wax-candles; and Augustine,
having once got so far, took care
that this pious practice should not be
discontinued even in the height of
summer. Another Sunday he would
put himself at the head of the charity-boys,
and walk through the church in
procession, bowing and making genuflexions
in evident imitation of Peter;
and at last the poor young man was
so far left to himself, that he would
not read the service properly, but
twanged it through his nose in a kind
of sing-song fashion, which he called
intoning, but which had simply this
effect, that nobody was able to follow
the meaning of the words.</p>

<p>These things were, as you may
suppose, very annoying to Martin,
who, over and over again, entreated
him to take care what he was doing.
But, in answer to every remonstrance,
Augustine would whip out
the musty pamphlet aforesaid, lay it
open before his father, and request
him to point out any special clause
condemnatory of the practices which
he followed. "If such a clause
exists," quoth he, "I knock under,
as in duty bound. If not, I apprehend
that I am merely pursuing a
course which has been sanctioned
from all antiquity." Martin tried to
convince him that a great many
things might be wrong, or at all
events injudicious, which were not
actually expressly set down as forbidden;
but no argument would avail
with Augustine, who said he was determined
to stand by the rubric, and, moreover,
to interpret that rubric according
to his own lights and inspiration.</p>

<p>This was bad enough. However,
had it been all, no great mischief
might have ensued. But curious
stories became current presently
regarding Augustine's walk and conversation.
It was said that he was
in the habit of holding secret colloquies
for hours with the Bishop of
Timbuctoo and others, notorious emissaries
of Peter; that he wore hair
cloth under his shirt, kept vigils and
fasts, and had an oratory fitted up in
his bedroom&mdash;with crucifixes and I
wot not what, clean contrary to the
commands of Martin. This much is
certain, that he framed a callendar of
his own out of some of the books
from Peter's discarded library, and
never wrote to his broker to buy him
some shares in a railway, or to his
grocer for a fresh supply of split-peas,
without dating his note "Festival of
Saint Balderdash," or "Eve of Saint
Rowena, V. and M.," instead of
specifying the day of the month, like
an ordinary orthodox Christian.
Then there were rumours current
about private confessions, to which
the young ladies, among whom Augustine
(being unmarried) was always a
favourite, were invited; of pilgrimages
to holy wells; and of other similar
junketings&mdash;which made many people
look upon Augustine as no better
than an innocent Peter. And they
were perfectly right. He was innocent
of any bad design, and I really
believe as virtuous a creature as ever
breathed. He was kind to the poor,
and would any day have given half
his stipend for their assistance and
relief. But he was weak in intellect,
puffed up with vanity, obstinate as a
team of mules, and credulous to the
last degree.</p>

<p>Novelties, as we all know, have a
prodigious attraction for many people.
In point of plain sense and doctrine,
there was no manner of comparison
between Martin and his son. If you
wished for nothing more than devotional
exercise, and an excellent sermon,
you might search the world
over without finding the equal of
Martin. But if your tastes led you
to indulge in qualified Peterisms, or
to listen to revivals of antiquated
notions, Augustine was your man.
A great many people, and among
others the Juggler, were vastly tickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
by Augustine's newfangled methods.
They could not enough admire his
ingenuity in volunteering to fight
Peter with his own weapons; and
they were ready, whenever he wished
it, to contribute their money towards
the expenses of festivals, or anything
else which Augustine might choose to
recommend. Even the Juggler,
though fond of his cash, gave something
towards the continuance of these
ceremonies&mdash;a fact which you will do
well to bear in mind when you come
to read some of the later passages of
this history.</p>

<p>I am sorry, however, to say, that
many of Augustine's original congregation
pursued a different course.
The innuendos against Martin, and
the hints which they had received as
to the possible comparative innocence
of Peter, had taken deep root in their
minds. They became, moreover, so
used to a ceremonial, which differed
little from that patronised by Peter,
except in being less gorgeous, that
they acquired a secret hankering for
the entire undiluted ritual; and their
nostrils thirsted for a whiff of frankincense,
which even Augustine, refused
to allow them. The consequence
was that they began, in imitation of
their pastor, to hold interviews with
Peter's emissaries, who, you may
suppose, were ready to meet them
half-way; and from little to more,
matters grew to such a head, that
many of Augustine's most sincere
disciples turned their back upon him,
and went over bodily to Peter! This
was an awful blow and discomfiture
to Augustine, who certainly had meditated
nothing of the sort; but it had
not the effect of curing him. He
still went on maundering about his
Uncle Peter, as if that venerable
individual had been as much sinned
against as sinning; and, in spite of
all that Martin could say, he would
not abate one jot of his observances.
Peter's emissaries, in the mean time,
were as active as ferrets in a rabbit
warren. They never emerged from
their holes without fetching out a new
victim, whom they paraded to the
whole world as a pattern of docility
and virtue. They wrote long letters
to Peter, glorifying themselves on
their success; and stating that the
time had now arrived when all Bullockshatch
was prepared to throw
itself at his feet. But in this they
reckoned entirely without their host.
They took it for granted that the
proceedings in Augustine's chapel
were approved of by the whole
tenantry on the estate; whereas the
fact was, that nine out of ten of them
looked to Martin as their spiritual
guide and counsellor, and entertained
an intense contempt for Augustine,
which they only refrained from expressing
in broad set terms, by reason
of his relationship to their pastor.
Peter, however, was very glad to
receive news of this kind; and swallowed
it, without making too minute
an inquiry. Long experience had
taught him that it was always best
to assume a victory, without being
particular as to the details; and, as
those who were intrusted with the
superintendence of Squire Bull's
estate, had latterly shown themselves
exceedingly amenable to his jurisdiction,
and quite hostile to the pretensions
of Martin, and of poor Patrick,
whom he longed in the first instance
to subjugate, he had some grounds
for supposing that the present was by
no means a bad opportunity for reviving
his old claim of dominion over
the whole territory of Bullockshatch.
These letters from his emissaries had
reached him before his interview with
Mat-o'-the-Mint&mdash;a circumstance
which perhaps may afford a clue to
the nature of his conversation with
that singularly acute individual.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

HOW PROTOCOL FELL FOUL OF SQUIRE OTHO; AND HOW HE WAS CALLED TO A RECKONING
IN CONSEQUENCE.</h3>

<p>After Mat-o'-the-Mint's return to
Bullockshatch, Protocol found himself
very much like a fish out of water.
That honest gentleman laboured
under a constitutional infirmity, being
subject to fits of hypochondria when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>ever
Squire Bull happened to be at
peace and amity with his neighbours.
At such times it was not very safe to
approach him. He was sulky, petulant,
and irritable; and in default of
any more legitimate occupation, usually
took an opportunity of picking a
quarrel with some of his fellow-servants.
You may therefore easily
believe, that he was no great favourite
in the household. Gray and others
would willingly have got rid of him
if they durst, but Protocol had been
long in the service, and knew so
many of their secret ways and doings,
that he had them completely in his
power. Therefore, whenever he began
to exhibit any of his pestilent
humours, the household would gather
round him, protesting that he was
the cleverest and most adroit fellow
in the universe, and indeed the only
man alive who could properly manage
a lawsuit.</p>

<p>"I have said it a thousand times
on my knees," quoth the Juggler on
such occasions, "that our revered
master, Squire Bull, never had so
acute a servant as the excellent Mr
Protocol. Show me the man like him
for finding out points in which the
honour of Bullockshatch is concerned!
I declare I am as proud of him as if
he were my own father."</p>

<p>And then they would all join in a
general chorus of flattery and adulation,
and request their esteemed friend
and colleague, Protocol, just to step
into his closet and look over the
county map, lest there should be any
case of a doubtful boundary which
might be disputed, or at all events to
write a few letters to the neighbouring
squires, telling them what he, Protocol,
thought of their general management.
At this, Protocol would begin
to look less grim, and finally retire
with a wink, as much as to say&mdash;"Aha!
my masters&mdash;wait here for a
little, and you shall see somewhat."
And in half-an-hour he would return,
carrying a map all ruled over with
red and blue lines, and a bundle of
old surveys, from which he would
pledge his credit to establish the fact
in any court of Christendom, that
Squire Bull had been swindled out of
at least three perches of unproductive
land, in a division of common
lands which was made a hundred
years before. The other members of
the household were but too happy
to see him occupied again, without
caring whether he was right or wrong;
and to work went Protocol, as merry
as a cricket, writing letters without
end, docketing notes, and making-believe
as though he had the weight
of the whole world on his shoulders.</p>

<p>You may easily conceive that this
kind of conduct, though it suited the
convenience of the Juggler and his
friends, was exceedingly odious to the
neighbouring squires, who were not
allowed to eat their meals in comfort
without being disturbed by Protocol.
One day he sent a messenger to Esquire
Strutt, as if from Squire Bull,
calling his attention to certain arrangements
in his household, which,
he said, ought to be modified; whereupon
Strutt, who was proverbially as
proud as a peacock, flew into a violent
passion, warned the messenger
off his estate, and sent back such an
answer to Protocol as made his ears
tingle for a fortnight. Then, whenever
any of the squires happened to
have a dispute among themselves,
originating from a drinking-bout or a
cock-fight, Protocol would instantly
write to them, tendering his good
offices and mediation, which offer
they, warned by experience, were
usually wise enough to decline. In
fact, these absurd doings of Protocol
brought Squire Bull at length into
such discredit with his neighbours,
that there was nothing on earth which
they dreaded so much as his interference.</p>

<p>Protocol was in one of his worst
humours when Mat-o'-the-Mint returned.
Everything had gone wrong
with him in the south. Don Vesuvius
had settled his affairs, clean contrary
to the wish of Protocol. Don
Ferdinando had got all he wanted,
simply by acting in a manner directly
opposite to his advice. Signor Tureen,
whom he favoured, had been worsted
in a lawsuit which he recommended,
and was saddled with enormous costs.
Peter, with whom he was bent on
currying favour, had been kicked out
of his patrimony, and Protocol had
not even the dubious credit of fetching
him back, that having been accomplished
by young Nap. Altogether
he had made a precious mess of it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
and many people, both in the upper
and under-servants' hall at Bullockshatch,
began to insinuate that, after
all, Master Protocol was no better
than a bungler. All this tended to
exasperate him to the utmost.</p>

<p>"It is a devilish hard thing," he
remarked to himself one day, as he
sat in the midst of his maps and correspondence&mdash;"It
is a devilish hard
thing that I can't find any men of
talent to carry my designs into execution!
There is scarcely a messenger
in my whole department who can
bamboozle a toll-keeper, much less
throw dust in the eyes of a ground-steward.
The Squire will no doubt
make an hideous outcry about this
unconscionable bill of expenses which
Mat-o'-the-Mint has run up; and
heaven only knows how far he may
have compromised my credit. Catch
me allowing him to go out again on
any errand of the kind! Never,
since I first nibbed a pen, were matters
in such a mess! I really must
do something for the sake of my own
character. But then the puzzle is
with whom to begin. I won't have
anything more to do with Jonathan,
that's flat. I dare not meddle further
in anything which concerns Esquire
North, for he is beginning to growl
already, like a bear as he is, and
Copenhagen is under his protection.
It would be a dangerous game to have
anything to say at present either to
Colonel Martinet or Don Ferdinando;
and, as for the South, why, I have
been already checkmated there. Ha!
an idea strikes me! Didn't I get
several letters lately from a relation of
Moses, complaining that he had suffered
some damage in a street-row
after dining with young Squire Otho?
And, now I think of it, Squire Otho
owes us some five or six pounds of interest
on a bond which he granted to
Bull, and he is behindhand with the
arrears. And, as I live, here's
another letter, which I threw aside at
the time, telling me that Cheeks the
marine, who is in John's pay, was
taken up one night to the watch-house
by a constable of Otho's, on a
charge of being drunk and disorderly!
Altogether, it is a capital case; and
as those barges which I sent along
the canal to frighten Don Vesuvius
are still lying thereabouts, I'll even
desire them to stop in front of Otho's
house, and demand immediate satisfaction."</p>

<p>This Otho was a young lad, who
had been put in possession of his
property with the full consent and
assistance of Squire Bull. It was a
little, rocky, dilapidated place, with
more ruins upon it than cottages, and
for many years had been entirely
overrun by gipsies. Long ago, before
the other estates in the country were
brought into proper cultivation, it was
reckoned of some importance; and
its proprietors were said to have held
their heads as high as O'Donoghue of
the Lakes, or Malachi of the golden
collar. But all that was matter of
tradition. It was difficult to understand
why Squire Bull should have
troubled himself about it, except it
was for this reason, that he had taken
possession of one or two small
islands in a lake adjoining the property,
which were well adapted for
the culture of currants; and which,
when he broke them up, were understood
to belong to nobody. However,
wishing to see the gipsies, who
were a troublesome race, expelled, he
agreed to settle Otho in this unprofitable
estate, and lent the poor lad a
trifle, just by way of keeping his head
above water at starting.</p>

<p>The villagers&mdash;for tenantry Otho
had almost none&mdash;were, on the whole,
an inoffensive race. They were said
to be infernal cheats and liars; but as
they only lied and cheated amongst
themselves, that did not much signify.
They had a great respect for
Bull, were very civil and obsequious
to any of his people who passed that
way, and would as soon have encountered
a goblin in the churchyard, as
have picked a quarrel with any of
them. Otho was, I suppose, by
much the poorest squire in all the
country round. His rental, nominally
small, was in reality next to nothing;
and it was supposed that he had a
hard struggle to make ends meet.
Such was the victim whom Protocol
selected, in order to enhance his individual
glory and renown.</p>

<p>Down came the barges across the
lake in front of Otho's house, each of
them crammed full of watchmen,
marines, and bargees, wearing Squire
Bull's livery. Upon this, Otho, sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>posing
that the visit was made in
compliment to himself, and little
dreaming that he had provoked the
enmity of so powerful a personage as
Protocol, put on his best coat and
hat, and was just stepping down to
the quay, when, to his amazement, a
writ was served upon him at the instance
of Squire Bull.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he said, unfolding
the document,&mdash;"'Account of loss
sustained by Mr Shylock, naturalised
servant of Squire Bull.&mdash;Magnificent
furniture, L.90, 6s. 8d. Do. China,
L.49, 3s. 8-1/4d. Inestimable jewellery,
L.505. Disturbance of mind, L.70,
10s. Medical attendance for subsequent
dysentery, L.13, 13s.' Good
heavens! is Esquire Bull mad? Shylock?
Why, that's the fellow who
has been bothering me for a year
past about some broken crockery, and
a fractured camp-stool! And what
may this other paper be? 'Compensation
to Mr William Cheeks, marine,
for unlawful detention of his person,
and injury to his character, he having
been apprehended as drunk and disorderly,
L.300! Why, the man was
discharged next morning with a simple
reprimand from the magistrate!
But here's a third&mdash;'Amercement for
injury done to Dimitri Palikaros, and
Odysseus Cosmokapeleion, inhabitants
of the currant islands, under the protection
of John Bull, Esquire, they
having been disturbed in their indefeasible
right of sleeping in the open
air, and forcibly conducted to the
watch-house, L.50.' Oh, it must be
a joke! Squire Bull cannot be in
earnest!"</p>

<p>But poor Otho was very soon made
to understand that it was no joke at
all, but a devilish serious matter.
He received a peremptory intimation
from Protocol's messenger, who was on
board one of the barges, that he must
pay the whole of the demands made
without demurring, within four-and-twenty
hours, otherwise he should be
under the disagreeable necessity of
laying an execution on his house;
and moreover, that, until this was
done, all the boats at the quay would
be laid under embargo. In vain did
Otho remonstrate against this flagrant
injustice, and offer to submit
the case to any squire in Christendom.
Protocol's man had special
orders, and would not abate a jot.
Not a soul was allowed to go out and
fish on the lake, though the livelihood
of many depended on it. Nay, he
had the inhumanity to seize some
cargoes of fresh beef, vegetables, and
other perishable articles which were
intended for the supply of the villagers,
and to keep them rotting in
the sun, until Otho should pay the
whole amount of the demand.</p>

<p>A more flagrant case was probably
never known. In all human probability,
twenty shillings would have
covered the whole extent of the losses
sustained by Shylock; and as for
Bill Cheeks, and the two other fellows
with unpronounceable names, it was
clear that the police magistrate had
only let them off too cheap. But
there was more than this. Otho was
also told that the time had come for
the settlement of his arrears, and
that he must, moreover, cede to Squire
Bull two islets, or rather rocks, in the
lake, on which his fishermen were
used to dry their nets, these not
being expressly marked as his in a
map in the possession of Protocol!
You may easily conceive that the
poor lad was driven to his wit's end
by these tyrannical proceedings.</p>

<p>"I never would have believed this
of Squire Bull!" cried he. "I always
thought him to be a generous,
frank, open-minded gentleman, with a
soul above pettifogging; and one
who would not be hard upon a debtor.
Esquire North would not have behaved
to me in this way&mdash;no, nor
would any other of my neighbours.
And I won't believe, even yet, that
it is the wish of the Squire to deal
so hardly with a poor lad, who has
not had time to set himself right with
the world. It must be Protocol's,
doing; though why he should use me
so, since I never gave him any offence
that I know of, passes my understanding.
However, I'll write to
the Baboonery, and learn what young
Nap thinks of the matter."</p>

<p>He could not have done a wiser
thing. Nap thought, as every one
else did, that the proceedings of
Protocol were not only shabby and
un-neighbour-like, but clearly Jewish
and unprincipled. Accordingly, he
took up the cudgels for Otho, declaring
that he could not see a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
young fellow, who was rather out at
the elbows, though from no fault of
his, treated in this abominable
fashion; and the clerk to whom he
gave the charge of the correspondence,
being a plain, straightforward, knock-me-down
sort of character, who had no
patience for diplomatic palaver, very
soon convinced Protocol that he was
like to have the worst of it. After a
good deal of correspondence, conducted
in a way which was the reverse
of creditable to Squire Bull's establishment,
a compromise was effected;
and Protocol seemed to think that he
had at last achieved a triumph. But
the contrary was the case: for the
people of Bullockshatch, and the
Squire himself, were mightily ashamed
of the use which had been made of
his name in this disreputable transaction.
The upper servants, at a
general meeting, voted it a dirty and
undignified transaction, and declared
that they washed their hands, henceforward,
of all participation in the
tricks and pantalooneries of Protocol.
This necessitated a call of the under-servants;
when the Juggler arose,
and with real tears in his eyes, (for
his wages depended upon the issue of
the vote,) declared that he believed
from the bottom of his heart, that a
nobler or more disinterested individual
than his honourable friend
Protocol never broke bread, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
and that he, the Juggler, was ready
to lay down the last drop of his
blood for the honour of Esquire Bull,
&amp;c.;&mdash;a sacrifice which was the more
creditable, as nobody thought of demanding
it. By dint of promise of
advancement in the household, he
persuaded divers of the servants,
especially one Caustic, to speak
strongly in favour of Protocol; but
the odds are, that he never would
have carried the vote but for the
dexterity of Protocol himself. That
veteran sinner was worth, in point of
ability, the whole of his colleagues
put together. He had a tongue that
could wile a bird off a tree; and the
most extraordinary thing about him,
next to his fondness for getting into
scrapes, was the facility with which
he got out of them. He favoured his
audience with a sketch of the services
which he had rendered to Squire
Bull, showing that in everything he
had done, he had the honour of
Bullockshatch at heart; and by cantering
over some portions of his story
where the ground was rather dubious,
sliding over others, and making a
prodigious prancing where his footing
was tolerably firm, he managed to
persuade the majority of the servants
that he really was a well-meaning individual,
and that they were bound
at all events to overlook this last
escapade about Otho, which no one
who had an atom of conscience could
pretend absolutely to justify.</p>

<p>Protocol was in high feather in
consequence of this whitewashing;
the more so, that at one time it
appeared very doubtful if even the
under servants could be induced to
support him. He and some of his
chums had a dinner and drink afterwards
at a servants' club to which
they belonged, where Proto. made
another speech, boasting that so long
as he lived, no man born on Squire
Bull's estate should be insulted by
any neighbouring proprietor, or be
laid in the stocks, or be hustled in a
village, without receiving ample
damages. All this sounded very well,
though it certainly looked like holding
out a premium to poaching; but
it so happened, that a short time afterwards
an old gentleman of the name
of Marshall, who was in Don Ferdinando's
service, and who had been
mainly instrumental in reinstating
him in his house, after it was broken
into by the rabble as I have already
told you, came over to Bullockshatch
on a holiday jaunt. Marshall's policy
through life had always been to return
a buffet for a blow; and, as the
fellows who created the uproar on
Ferdinando's estate were no more to
be reasoned with than so many wild
Indians, whom indeed they resembled
in their devilish practices of stabbing,
tomahawking, ravishing, and roasting
alive, he was by no means scrupulous
in his method of putting them down.
Some of the insurgents, who had fled
to Bullockshatch, had succeeded, by
dint of unmitigated lying, in getting
up a strong feeling among the villagers
against Marshall, whom they
represented as a man-eating tiger,
with so debauched a digestion, that
he could not sleep at night unless
he had previously supped upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
child. The people of Bullockshatch
were exceedingly credulous upon such
points, for it is on record that
about a hundred years before, when
poor Donald, as kindly a creature as
ever fasted on oatmeal, came down
from the hills, the children were sent
into the coal-cellar, lest haply the
sight of a plump one might whet his
uncivilised appetite. Be that as it
may, a general impression had gone
abroad that Marshall was no better
than a cannibal; and during the
short while he remained in Bullockshatch,
not a nursery-maid was allowed
to take the usual airing in the
streets.</p>

<p>But he did not remain long. Spies
were set upon him; and one day
when he took a fancy to look into
a brewery, just by way of seeing
how the beer was made, he was
assailed by a whole gang of ragamuffins,
who cursed, kicked, cuffed,
and spat upon him, tore off his moustaches,
damned him for a persecuting
foreigneering scoundrel, and would
probably have murdered him, had he
not, by great good luck, escaped into
a pot-house hard by. Even then he
was hardly safe, for the mob tried to
gut the premises. You may be sure
that, after experiencing this treatment,
Marshall did not remain long
in Bullockshatch; in fact, he took
himself off next morning, protesting
that he would rather sojourn among
the Hottentots, than be exposed to
such treatment at the hands of a
civilised community. So far as he
was concerned, he wished to take no
farther notice of the matter; but the
household of Don Ferdinando, considering
this a direct insult to themselves
and their master, desired the
head-steward to write to Protocol,
demanding immediate satisfaction.
This was an awkward thrust; for, if
Protocol was entitled to insist on
compensation from Otho, for the injuries
done by his people to Bill
Cheeks, Shylock, and Cosmokapeleion,
it was evident that, on the same
principle, Ferdinando's steward had a
right to sue Squire Bull for the injury
and damages inflicted upon Marshall.
Proto., however, refused pointblank
to give any satisfaction, or to do anything
at all in the matter; whereupon
Ferdinando's steward gave him due
notice, that in all time coming he
should consider himself and his master
relieved from all responsibility, if
any of Squire Bull's people should
happen to be tarred and feathered
when straying beyond bounds. What
was even more unpleasant, Esquire
North sent him notice to the same
effect; and North was not a man
likely to be worse than his word.</p>

<p>I have thought it right to tell ye
these things just now, in order that
you may understand Protocol's usual
method of doing business. I must
now relate to you a circumstance
which threw the whole of Bullockshatch
into a most awful quandary.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

HOW PETER CLAIMED SUPREMACY IN BULLOCKSHATCH&mdash;AND HOW THE JUGGLER THREW THE
BLAME UPON AUGUSTINE.</h3>

<p>One morning after breakfast, Squire
Bull, who was then mightily taken
up with a glass warehouse, which
some people had persuaded him to
erect in his park, for the purpose of
showing off his neighbours' wares in
opposition to his own, called as usual
for his newspaper.</p>

<p>"I half begin to think," quoth he,
settling himself in his easy chair, and
airing the broadsheet at the fire,
"that I have been bubbled in this
matter. What good this puffing and
vaunting of other folk's commodities
is to do to my villagers, I do not
exactly see; and, as for the tenantry,
they appear to be against it to a man.
Besides, I have a strong suspicion
that in the long run I shall have to
pay the piper. However, let us see if
anything is stirring abroad.&mdash;Eh!
what's this? A letter from that miscreant
Peter! Am I in my right
senses?"</p>

<p>And, sure enough, in the most
conspicuous part of the newspaper
there appeared the following
document:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">We, Peter</span>, Lord Paramount of
the whole world, and Supreme Suzerain
of the Squirearchy thereof, to all
to whom these presents may come,
Greeting. <span class="smcap">Know ye</span>, that We, out
of Our infinite condescension and
mercy, and moved thereto by the
love which We bear to Our subjects
of Bullockshatch, have determined
from henceforth, and in all time coming,
to grant unto them such spiritual
rights and privileges as We have
accorded to others of Our subjects
elsewhere. Also, for the end that
Our loving subjects of Bullockshatch
may the better accommodate themselves
to Our Will in this matter,
and render to us, through Our delegates,
the homage which is justly
Our due, We have resolved to divide
and erect, as We do hereby divide
and erect, the whole of Our territory
of Bullockshatch into thirteen separate
parishes, appointing thereunto
for each a Superintendent, who shall
henceforth, and in all time coming,
derive his style and title from the
parish to which he is appointed by
Us; and We command, require, and
enjoin Our said loving subjects to
render to Our said Superintendents all
obedience and fealty, as they shall
answer to Us thereupon. And in
order that all things may be
properly administered, We have appointed
Our dearly beloved Nicholas,
formerly Superintendent of Hippopotamus,
to be our Arch-Superintendent
on Our estate of Bullockshatch,
with the title and designation
of Lord Arch-Superintendent
of Smithfield, granting to him
all the rights of coal, fuel, faggot,
turf, twig, and combustibles which
were formerly enjoyed by any of
his predecessors in office. And as
a token of their gratitude for this
Our unparalleled condescension and
mercy, We ordain and require that
Our loving subjects of Bullockshatch
shall each and all of them attend and
assist at three solemn masses, to be
performed for the soul of the late
Guido Fawkes, Esquire, of happy
memory. And We declare this to be
a public and irrevocable decree.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Signed</i>) <span class="smcap">Peter</span>."</p></div>

<p>Language is inadequate to express
the paroxysm of wrath into which
Squire Bull was thrown by the
perusal of this insolent document! He
foamed at the mouth, kicked over
the breakfast table, dashed the newspaper
on the carpet, and tore down
the bell-rope.</p>

<p>"He the Lord Paramount of Bullockshatch,
the lying old villain that
he is! He pretend to jurisdiction
within my estate! But I'll trounce
him! Ho, there! Who's without?
Fetch me here the Juggler instantly!
Body of me, that it should ever have
come to this! These are the thanks I
get from the ungrateful old he-goat for
having taken some of his people into
my service, and persuaded my tenantry,
sorely against their will, to make
an annual allowance for that school of
his, which is no better than a nest of
Jesuits! If I don't make the viper
feel&mdash;So, so! Master Juggler, you are
there, are you? Things have come
to a pretty pass, when I can't take
up a newspaper, without finding myself
openly insulted, and my rights of
property denied!"</p>

<p>Now, be it known to you that the
Juggler was anything but comfortable
in his mind. He was fully conscious
that he had been imposed on by
Peter; and, further, that he and his
associates had done everything in
their power to back up Peter's pretensions.
This they did less out of
hatred to Martin (though they bore
him no great love) than from a desire
to ingratiate themselves with some of
the under servants who came from
the farm over the pond, and were
known adherents of Peter. But from
one thing to another, they had gone so
far, as we have already seen, relaxing
and abolishing all the old regulations of
the estate against the interference of
Peter, that it really seemed as though
he had only to step in and take possession.
Further, the Juggler was
somewhat at a loss to know how he
could satisfactorily explain the nature
of the mission upon which his relative,
Mat-o'-the-Mint, had been despatched;
besides some other little
circumstances which looked confoundedly
suspicious. For example,
about a year before, one Dicky Squeal,
a notorious Peterite, had been detected
tampering with the dies from
which Squire Bull's tokens were
struck, and cutting out certain letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
which were understood to signify that
Mr Bull held possession of his estate
altogether independent of Peter. Instead
of punishing him for this, the
Juggler had just announced his intention
of sending Dicky Squeal on a
second mission to Signor Macaroni's
estate, where he might be within
earshot of Peter. Altogether, it is
no wonder if the Juggler felt the
reverse of happy when summoned to
appear before his master. However,
he was resolved to brazen it out as
he best could.</p>

<p>"Insulted, did you say, sir; and
your rights of property denied? The
thing is clean impossible! Nobody
dares insult my noble master&mdash;the
most excellent, kind, hospitable,
beneficent landlord that ever kept
open house! O sir, if you but knew
the depth of my affection&mdash;the almost
overwhelming load, as I may say, of
love and regard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Master Juggler!
quoth the Squire sharply, "I've heard
all that palaver before, and mayhap
once too often. You ask who has
insulted me&mdash;I'll tell you in four
words&mdash;that unmitigated rascal,
Peter!</p>

<p>"Peter! alackaday!" replied the
Juggler, with an affected whine of
consternation. "Is it possible that
he can have been left so far to his
own devices! Surely, surely, my
dear master, there must be some
mistake in this."</p>

<p>"No mistake at all!" roared the
Squire; "and, what is more, there
shall be no mistake about it. Look
here&mdash;" continued he, pointing out
the paragraph. "Have you read
that?"</p>

<p>The Juggler had done so, every
word of it, that blessed morning; but
as he wished to gain time, he adjusted
his glasses, and began to con it over
with an appearance of intense interest.
Meanwhile the Squire occupied himself
in tying knots on a new lash for
his hunting-whip.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say to that
now?" quoth he, when the Juggler
had concluded the perusal.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;that is&mdash;I am strongly
of opinion," faltered the other, "that
the whole thing is a mere misconception."</p>

<p>"A what?" roared the Squire.</p>

<p>"A misconception," quavered the
Juggler. "As I read this document,
which I confess is not so well worded
as it might have been, I conclude that
Peter merely wishes to provide for
the spiritual wants of his own people,
not that he in the least degree intends
to question your lawful authority.
And further&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark-ye!" interrupted the Squire,
his eye kindling like a coal, "I am
not going to stand any of your nonsense.
I, John Bull, stand here as
the sole proprietor of Bullockshatch,
and no man alive shall presume to
question my title with impunity.
Look to it, Master Juggler, for I
know you better than you think.
I may be at times too easy and careless,
but I have an eye in my head
notwithstanding, and I know what
your friends Gray and Claretson have
been doing. Mind this&mdash;you as head-steward
are responsible to me, and if
I find you playing false in this matter,
by the Lord Harry you shall
answer for it!"</p>

<p>"Me!" cried the Juggler, in the
shrill tones of injured innocence.
"How could such an idea enter into
your blessed brain? I protest that
never man served master with more
entire devotion. May my next
tragedy be worse than my first,
if it does not bring tears into my eyes,
to hear you talking in this way of
your affectionate Juggling Johnny!"
Here he went through a little bit of
pantomime similar to that performed
by Mr T. P. Cooke when bidding
farewell to Shewsan, immediately
before his execution. "As for Gray
and Claretson, or any other of them,
if they have been doing anything contrary
to the rules of the household, it
is wholly unbeknownst to me. O! if
your honour only knew the trouble
they give me sometimes, and the
watch I am obliged to keep over them
to see that they do their duty! I
really think that the labour is telling
upon my precious health. If it be
your pleasure that they should be
packed about their business, I'll do it&mdash;only
don't break my heart by
doubting my devotion in your service."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" quoth the Squire,
who was always easily mollified,
"let's say no more about that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
present. The main thing is to put
down that insolent varlet, Peter.
And, as you say you are determined
to uphold my authority, it will be
just as well that you should tell that to
the household. So just step into my
closet&mdash;you will find paper and ink
on the table&mdash;and write me a handsome
letter to Martin, expressive of
your indignation at Peter, and your
determination to give him a ribroasting
at the earliest opportunity."</p>

<p>At this the Juggler hemmed and
coughed, said something about a
whitlow in his finger, and would fain
have postponed writing for the present.
But the Squire was peremptory,
and would listen to no excuse; so
<i>nolens volens</i>, Johnny was obliged to
walk into the closet and do his master's
bidding.</p>

<p>Having secured the door, he first
of all took out of his waistcoat
pocket a thimble and peas, and began
trying to cheat himself, as was his
wont whenever he found himself in
a scrape. After his ideas were clarified
by that ingenious process, he
broke out into the following soliloquy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Am I done for, or am I not?
Gadzooks! I must say that it looks
extremely like it. That old blockhead
Bull is in a thorough passion,
and I need never expect to talk him
round. What an ass that fellow
Peter is! If he had only waited a
little, we could have managed the
whole matter quite easily, but now
he has put his foot in it, and must
even take the consequences. But
how am I to manage with Gray and
Claretson? They are both committed
as deeply as can be to Peter, and
I suspect that he can prove it by their
own letters. I wonder if I could persuade
them to quit the Squire's service
without making any noise about
it! No&mdash;that they won't do; and
the mischief is that they know a thing
or two more than is convenient.
Then what am I to write to that
old pantaloon Martin, whom I have
not spoken to for many a day? If
I commit myself against Peter, Gray
and Claretson will be down upon me
to a dead certainty, and I shall have
to account for all Mat-o'-the Mint's
blunders, which would puzzle any
conjurer living. If I don't, the whole
household will suppose that I have
been in regular league with Peter,
and then I lose my place. They
suspect me already; for no later than
yesterday that stupid errand-boy of
mine, Hips, came down with a tester
towards buying a new hat for Hippopotamus;
and, to say the truth, I have
a letter from that same individual
at this moment in my pocket. Couldn't
I manage to temporise about Peter,
and throw the blame on somebody
else? Not a bad idea! There's
that noodle Augustine with a back
providentially fitted for the burden!
If I can make him the scapegoat,
I may still contrive to throw dust
in the eyes of the Squire!"</p>

<p>So saying, Johnny pocketed his
thimble and peas, and straightway
indited this doughty epistle to Martin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I
have this moment learned with great
astonishment and surprise, the insidious
attempt which has been made
by Peter to extend his authority in
Bullockshatch. This gives me the
greater surprise, because I consider
myself ill used by Peter, having on previous
occasions behaved with marked
civility to his people, and having
moreover shown myself anything but
hostile to his exercising his functions
here, moderately and discreetly, and
within due limits. However, you may
rely upon it, that the matter shall be
thoroughly sifted, and such steps
adopted as may vindicate the proper
position of my honoured master,
not forgetting your own. What
these steps may be, I cannot yet say,
because it will be necessary in a matter
of this importance to consult an
attorney. However, you may keep
your mind at ease. What Peter shall
or shall not have, will be determined
in proper time; till when, it would be
premature to enter into further explanations.</p>

<p>"Having thus explicitly stated my
sentiments with regard to this unusual
matter, it would be wrong in me to
conceal from you that I regard your
son Augustine as a dangerous enemy
to the tranquillity of Bullockshatch.
I write this with unfeigned sorrow, but
my natural candour renders it impossible
for me to maintain any dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>guise.
The Peterizing tendency of the
practices adopted by Mr Augustine
have long been the subject of serious
remark in the household, and have
doubtless contributed very much to
the difficulties which have now arisen.
To be plain with you, I regard your
son as being actually more culpable
than Peter.</p>

<p>"You will farther pardon me,
Reverend Sir, for remarking that your
own conduct is not altogether without
reproach, seeing that you might have
used your authority more decidedly in
cautioning your son against imitating
the mummeries of Peter.&mdash;I am,
Reverend and Dear Sir, your best
adviser and friend,</p>

<p class="right">
(<i>Signed</i>) "<span class="smcap">J. Juggler</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"For Dr Martin, These."</p></div>

<p>"If that letter does not succeed,"
quoth the Juggler after he had read
it over for the second time, "I surrender
all faith in human gullibility.
It shall appear to-morrow morning
in the newspapers; and as to what
may follow after, why&mdash;we shall
just leave that to the chapter of
accidents."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

HOW AUGUSTINE RETORTED ON THE JUGGLER; AND HOW HIPPOPOTAMUS CAME OVER
TO BULLOCKSHATCH.</h3>

<p>Next morning, the letter appeared
in print, and was circulated all over
Bullockshatch. You have no idea
what a commotion it created. Some
people who knew the Juggler well
from old experience, pronounced it
at once to be a mere tub thrown out
to catch a whale, and argued that in
reality it meant nothing. But others,
who detested Peter from the bottom
of their hearts, and yet felt a sort of
sneaking kindness for the Juggler,
were loud in their commendation and
praise of his spirited, straightforward
conduct; and declared their firm conviction
that he would go on, and
give Peter such a trouncing for his
insolence, as he had not received for
many a day. Those who were of the
Gray and Claretson faction, looked
exceedingly glum; swore that they
had always considered the Juggler
as little better than a time-serving
fellow; and that, notwithstanding
his braggadocio, he durst not take a
single step against Peter. "If we
are in for it," said they, "so is he.
Let him clear up those doings of
Mat-o'-the-Mint as he best can."
Peter's friends, of course, were furious;
at least the majority of them,
who did not comprehend the truth of
the axiom, that the main use of
language is to conceal ideas. Others,
who were more learned in Jesuitry,
winked and hinted at a dispensation.</p>

<p>But the man, of all others, who
was the most astounded&mdash;and no
wonder&mdash;was poor Augustine. You
must know that, for several years,
the Juggler had been on extremely
cool terms with Dr Martin, and
seldom, if ever, set foot within his
church. But, as it had always been
considered a point of etiquette that
the Squire's head-steward should
attend some place of worship, the
Juggler, who could do nothing like
other people, compromised the matter
by joining two congregations at once.
Of a Sunday forenoon he was a
regular attendant on the ministrations
of Augustine; in the afternoon,
he went to a meeting-house where
the minister was a relative of Jack's.
He had helped Augustine to set up
his nick-nackeries; assisted at the
most suspicious of his ceremonies;
and never made the slightest objection
to the practices, which he now
thought fit to denounce to Martin!
Augustine, at the first sight of the
letter, doubted the evidence of his
eyesight.</p>

<p>"Bones of Saint Thomas-&agrave;-Beckett!"
said he, "is it possible that he
can have written this? Supposing
that I was to blame&mdash;which I am not&mdash;is
it for him to turn against me at
the last hour, after all that he has
said and done, and throw the whole
blame of Peter's delinquencies at my
door? But I won't stand it&mdash;that's
flat. I'll write him a tickler that
shall touch him to the quick, if he
has any spark of conscience remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>ing;
and, now that I think on't, I'll
just step over to the vestry, where I
shall be less disturbed."</p>

<p>I don't know what kind of disturbance
Augustine contemplated at home,
but it must have been slight indeed
compared with that which he was
doomed to meet at the chapel. All
the ragamuffins in the neighbourhood,
who took their cue from the Juggler,
were congregated around the door;
and no sooner did Augustine appear,
than he was saluted with yells of
"No candles! no sham Peters! down
with the humbug!" and so forth; so
that the poor gentleman had much
difficulty in elbowing his way to the
vestry, where he locked himself in,
not altogether, as you may easily believe,
in a comfortable frame of mind.
When he attempted to perform service,
matters grew worse and worse.
There was shouting, braying, and
hissing, both inside and outside the
door, so that a large posse of constables
was required to keep the mob
in order; and, at last, the chapel was
shut up.</p>

<p>Augustine, however, wrote his letter,
which was a stinger, though
rather too long, and published it. It
is just possible that he may have received
an answer; but if so, I have
not seen it, nor can I therefore undertake
to clear up the mystery which
envelopes this remarkable episode.
This much is certain, that if Augustine's
statement was true, the Juggler
gave ample proof, if proof was
necessary, that he was still eminently
qualified to exhibit feats of dexterity
at any booth in Bartholomew Fair,
and could turn his back upon himself
with any man in the kingdom.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that the Juggler,
after having written his famous letter
to Martin, would very willingly have
held his tongue, until he was compelled
to address the household. But
it is not easy, when a fire is once
kindled, to put it out. Not that the
kindling was the work of Johnny, for
Peter's insolent proclamation was of
itself enough to raise a conflagration
in Bullockshatch; but now that the
head-steward had declared himself&mdash;or
was supposed to have done so&mdash;it
was necessary that he should go
through with it. It so happened, that
a day or two afterwards he was
engaged, along with others of the
Squire's servants, to eat custard with
one of the village magistrates; and
the good man, in proposing his health,
could not help alluding to the very
noble, magnificent, and satisfactory
letter which had been written by the
honourable head-steward on the subject
of Peter's unwarrantable attack
on the liberties of the Squire. At
this the whole company rose and
cheered, so that the Juggler could not
very well forbear touching on the
topic, though he handled it with as
much caution as he would have used
towards a heated poker. He talked
about his determination to uphold
the just rights of Esquire Bull, and so
forth; but what those rights were, he
did not specify, neither did he drop
any hint as to the nature of the steps
which he proposed to adopt. But you
may conceive his disgust, when he
heard two of the servants whom he
had brought along with him, fall foul of
Peter in the most unqualified terms!
The first of these, one Kewpaw, so
named after his habitual pronunciation
of his birthplace in the North
farm, had the exquisite taste to say
that he, being a Justice of the Peace,
would be but too happy and proud to
preside at the trial either of Peter, or
of his delegate Hippopotamus, for
the insult offered to Squire Bull, and
would give them a practical insight
into the nature of a <i>mittimus</i>; while
the other, who had been wild in his
youth, but now sat at the head of the
upper servants' table, declared his
intention of dancing a fandango on
the hat of Hippopotamus on the first
convenient opportunity. These dignified
speeches were of course enthusiastically
cheered, though they were
as bitter as wormwood to the Juggler,
who felt himself every hour more
and more compromised before he had
made up his mind to any definite
course of action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Martin, who knew from
old experience how little dependence
could be placed in the Juggler at any
time, bestirred himself to take the
sense of the people of Bullockshatch
as to Peter's arrogant pretensions.
He was fully conscious that a general
demonstration on their part would
not only be highly gratifying to the
Squire, but extremely useful in influ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>encing
the views of the servants.
Meetings were accordingly held in
every corner of the estate, at which
both tenantry and villagers signified
their readiness to stand by
Squire Bull to the last, and voted
him addresses to that effect. It was
true that Obadiah, though he durst
not declare openly for Peter, took
every occasion of carping at the proceedings
of Martin&mdash;insinuating, in
his sneaking way, that this access of
zeal might be traced to a wholesome
regard to the maintenance of his
tithes, "wherein," quoth Obadiah,
"I, though a humble labourer in
the vineyard, have neither part nor
portion." But Martin, who knew
the man, and valued his remarks
accordingly, proceeded in the performance
of his duty; being well aware
that even an angel of light would
have been subjected to the malignant
criticisms of Obadiah.</p>

<p>A day was presently fixed when
Squire Bull was to receive the addresses
of the tenantry at the manor-house.
Nobody doubted that the
answers would have been bluff,
hearty, and decided, as was the
Squire's usual manner; and that
Peter would receive more than a hint
of the probable reward of his impertinence.
And, most assuredly, had
the matter depended alone upon the
disposition of the Squire, they would
have been abundantly gratified. But
there was an old rule of the estate,
that, on such occasions, the answer
to the addresses should be written by
the head-steward, not by the Squire,
who was seldom allowed to look at
the paper before he was required to
read it. When the day came, there
was an immense concourse of deputations,
from all parts of the estate,
gathered in the lobbies, and each
was successively ushered into the
drawing-room, where the Squire was
seated, with the Juggler standing at
his elbow. When the first address
was finished, the Juggler slipped a
sheet of paper into the hand of the
Squire, who forthwith began to read
it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I feel very much
obliged to you for the trouble you
have taken in this matter, which, let
me observe, is personal to myself.
You may rely upon it, I can maintain
my own position, and will try to do
so, provided that position is tenable.
I am resolved to maintain Martin in
his rights whenever these rights are
ascertained; and to do to Peter exactly
what shall seem most proper
under the present perplexing circumstances.
In the mean time, you had
better return to your families, and
look after their education; and I
have the honour to wish you a good
morning."</p>

<p>This, with a little variation, was
the answer given to all the addresses;
and I wish you had seen the faces of
the deputations when they found
themselves thus soused over, as it
were, with a bucket of cold water!
The most extraordinary circumstance
of all was, that the Juggler seemed
to think that he had done a very
clever thing, and produced a masterpiece;
for he stood the whole while
the answer was being read with his
finger at his mouth, and a leer upon
his face, prying into the countenances
of the honest people, like a magpie
scrutinising a marrow-bone. This
was all the satisfaction which the
men of Bullockshatch received at that
time in return for their trouble; and
had they not known perfectly well
who was at the bottom of the
answers, it is highly probable that
few more addresses would have found
their way to the mansion-house.
Indeed, many folks are of opinion that
the Juggler would have liked nothing
better than a total stoppage of these
addresses, and that the answers were
purposely framed to put an end to
them. In the midst of all this
commotion, who should appear in
Bullockshatch but our old friend
Hippopotamus, whom Peter had
appointed arch-superintendent of
Smithfield. Little he cared for the
Squire, or for any one else in the
world, except his master Peter; and
as to the Juggler, he considered that
he had him entirely under his thumb,
on account of certain transactions
which had previously taken place
between them. So he too set himself
down to write and publish a letter,
which was exceedingly humble and
vain-glorious, (the two qualities
being more nearly allied than many
people suppose,) but withal sarcastical;
and you may be sure that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
did not spare either the Juggler or
Mat-o'-the-Mint, whom he flatly
accused of being privy to the designs
of Peter. By this time a perfect
mania for writing letters had seized
the whole population of Bullockshatch.
The newspapers contained nothing
else but long columns of epistles;
and even Mat-o'-the-Mint could not
resist trying his hand at composition.
It seems that some gentleman had
thought it worth his while to inquire
whether there was really any truth
in the reports which were currently
circulated, and Matthew replied as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;If I were at liberty to tell
you what I could tell you, you would
know more than you do at present.
But it is unnecessary to remark that
confidential communications are to be
considered as things strictly private
until they are divulged; and in a
matter connected with the interests of
Esquire Bull, I must be permitted to
maintain that reserve which is not
incongruous with an explicit declaration
of the truth. Further, I would
suggest that the fallibility of Peter
having been impugned, renders the
point at issue still more dubious.
Hoping that this explanation will
prove satisfactory, I remain, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Signed</i>) "<span class="smcap">Mat-o'-the-Mint</span>."</p></div>

<p>And this was absolutely published
in the papers as an entire vindication
of Matthew!</p>

<p>Hippopotamus, however, did not
care a rush either for addresses or
epistles. He was perfectly convinced
in his mind that so long as the
Squire's household remained without
change, he had nothing earthly to
fear; and, accordingly, he snapped
his fingers and laughed at the whole
opposition. He had brought over
with him from foreign parts such a
collection of tapestry, brocades, images,
pyxes, censers, and gilded sheep-hooks,
as utterly eclipsed the glory of
poor Augustine's paraphernalia, and
these he took occasion to display with
all the pride and satisfaction possible.
Then he issued addresses to the people
of Bullockshatch, congratulating them
on their emancipation from the thraldom
of Martin, and comparing them
to a brood of goslings shadowed by
the infallible pinions of Peter. He
kept altogether out of sight hair-shirts,
flagellations, incremations,
holocausts, and such other spiritual
stimulants; but promised them any
amount of pardons, indulgences, and
whitewashing. Some of his friends
and followers went even further.
Among these was a certain Father
Ignition, who had taken a fancy to
dress himself in serge with a rope
round his waist, and to walk barefooted
about the streets. This cleanly
creature devised and promulgated a
plan, by means of which he engaged,
under the penalty of washing himself
in the case of failure, to bring round
every mother's son in Bullockshatch
to Peter's fold and obedience. He
proposed that a stout strapping
country wench, of approved principles,
from the farm on the other side of the
pond, should be smuggled into each
family on the Squire's estate, as
laundry maid, scullion, or to take
charge of the nursery. These hussies
were to act as general spies, reporting
all that passed in the household to
him, Father Ignition; and were,
moreover, to pervert the children,
conveying them secretly to Peter's
schools, and stuffing them with Roman
toffy; and to get as intimate as possible
with the young gentlemen,
especially such as might have been
inclined to Augustine's persuasion.
In this way, the morality of which he
held to be unquestionable, Father
Ignition volunteered to raise a large
crop of converts, to be ready, like
asparagus, in the spring.</p>

<p>In this position stood matters in
Bullockshatch towards the expiry of
the holidays, during which no business
was ever transacted in the household.
You shall learn anon what took place
after the servants were re-assembled;
and I promise you, that you will hear
something fit to make your hair stand
on end. But these things are too
important to be narrated at the end
of a chapter.</p>

<h2>HARRY BOLTON'S CURACY.</h2>


<p>One of the greatest enjoyments
which are likely to fall to the lot of a
man in middle life, is to spend a week
or so with the old school-and-college
companion whom he has not seen
since the graver page of life has
turned over for both parties. It is as
unlike any ordinary visit-making as
possible. It is one of the very few
instances in which the complimentary
dialogue between the guest and his
entertainer comes to have a real force
and meaning. One has to unlearn,
for this special occasion, the art so
necessary in ordinary society, of interpreting
terms by their contraries.
And in fact it is difficult, at first, for
one who has been used for some years
to a social atmosphere, whose warmth
is mainly artificial, to breathe freely
in the natural sunshine of an old
friend's company; just as a native
Londoner is said sometimes to pine
away, when removed into the fresh
air of the country. We are so used
to consider the shake of the hand, and
the "Very glad to see you," of the
hundred and one people who ask us
to dinner, as merely a polite and
poetical form of expressing, "You
certainly are a bore; but as you are
here, I must make the best of you"&mdash;that
it costs us an effort to comprehend
that "How are you, old fellow?"
does, in the present case,
imply a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> hope that we are as
sound in health and heart, if not as
young, as formerly. And especially
when a man's pursuits have led him a
good deal into the world, and many
of his warmer feelings have been, insensibly
perhaps, chilled by the contact,
the heartiness of his reception by
some old college friend who has led a
simple life, the squire of his paternal
acres, or the occupant of a country
parsonage, and has gained and lost
less by the polishing process of society,
will come upon him with a
strangeness almost reproachful. But
once fairly fixed within the hospitable
walls, the natural tone is recognised, and
proves contagious; the formal
incrustations of years melt in the first
hour of after-dinner chat, and the
heart is opened to feelings and language
which it had persuaded itself
were long forgotten. And when the
end of your three weeks' holiday
arrives at last, which you cannot
persuade yourself has been more than
three days, (though you seem to have
lived over again the best half of your
life in the time,) you have so far
forgotten the conventional rules of
good-breeding, that when your friend
says to you on the last evening,
"Must you really go? Can't you
stay till Monday?" you actually take
him at his word, and begin to cast
about in your mind for some possible
excuse for stealing another couple of
days or so, though you have heard
the same expression from the master
of every house where you have happened
to visit, and never dreamt of
understanding it in any other than its
civilised (<i>i. e.</i>, <i>non-natural</i>) sense&mdash;as
a hint to fix a day for going, and
stick to it, that your entertainer may
"know the worst."</p>

<p>I was heartily glad, therefore, when
at last I found that there was nothing
to prevent me from paying a visit
(long promised, and long looked forward
to, but against which, I began
to think, gods and men had conspired)
to my old and true friend Lumley.
I dare say he has a Christian
name; indeed, I have no reason to
doubt it, and, on the strength of an
initial not very decipherable, prefixed
to the L in his signature, I have never
hesitated to address him, "J. Lumley,
Esq.;" but I know him as Long
Lumley, and so does every man who,
like myself, remembers him at Oxford;
and as Long Lumley do all his
cotemporaries know him best, and
esteem him accordingly; and he must
excuse me if I immortalise him to the
public, in spite of godfathers and godmothers,
by that more familiar appellation.
A cousin was with him at
college, a miserable, sneaking fellow,
who was known as "Little Lumley;"
and if, as I suspect, they were both
Johns or Jameses, it is quite desirable
to distinguish them unmistakably;
for though the other <i>has</i> the
best shooting in the country, I would
not be suspected of spending even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
first week of September inside such a
fellow's gates.</p>

<p>But Long Lumley was and is of a
very different stamp; six feet three,
and every inch a gentleman. I wish
he was not, of late years, quite so
fond of farming: a man who can
shoot, ride, and translate an ode of
Horace as he can, ought to have a
soul above turnips. It is almost the
only point on which we are diametrically
opposed in tastes and habits.
We nearly fell out about it the very
first morning after my arrival.</p>

<p>Breakfast was over&mdash;a somewhat
late one in honour of the supposed
fatigues of yesterday's journey, and it
became necessary to arrange proceedings
for the day. What a false politeness
it is, which makes a host responsible
for his guests' amusement!
and how often, in consequence, are
they compelled to do, with grimaces
of forced satisfaction, the very thing
they would not! However, Lumley
and myself were too old friends to have
any scruples of delicacy on that point.
I had been eyeing him for some minutes
while he was fastening on a
pair of formidable high-lows, and was
not taken by surprise when the proposal
came out, "Now, old fellow,
will you come and have a look at my
farm?"</p>

<p>"Can't I see it from the window?"</p>

<p>"Stuff! come, I must show you my
sheep: I assure you they are considered
about the best in this neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll taste the mutton
any day you like, and give you my
honest opinion."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass now, but get your
hat and come along; it's going to be
a lovely day; and we'll just take a turn
over the farm&mdash;there's a new thrashing
machine I want to show you, too, and
then back here to lunch."</p>

<p>"Seriously then, Lumley, I won't
do anything of the kind. I do you the
justice to believe, that you asked me
here to enjoy myself; and that I am
quite ready to do in any fairly rational
manner; and I flatter myself I am in
nowise particular; but as to going
bogging myself among turnips, or
staring into the faces and poking the
ribs of short-horns and south-downs&mdash;why,
as an old friend, you'll excuse
me."</p>

<p>"Hem! there's no accounting for
tastes," said Lumley, in a half-disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "there certainly is
not."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said he&mdash;he never
lost his good humour&mdash;"what shall we
do? I'll tell you&mdash;you remember
Harry Bolton? rather your junior, but
you must have known him well, because
he was quite in our set from the
first&mdash;to be sure, didn't you spill him
out of a tandem at Abingdon corner?
Well, he is living now about nine miles
from here, and we'll drive over and
see him. I meant to write to ask him
to dine here, and this will save the
trouble."</p>

<p>"With all my heart," said I; "I
never saw him since I left Oxford. I
fancied I heard of his getting into some
mess&mdash;involved in some way, was he
not?"</p>

<p>"Not involved exactly; but he
certainly did make himself scarce from
a very nice house and curacy which
he had when he first left Oxford, and
buried himself alive for I don't know
how long, and all for the very queerest
reason, or rather without any reason
at all. Did you never hear of it?"</p>

<p>"No; only some vague rumour, as
I said just now."</p>

<p>"You never heard, then, how he
came into this neighbourhood? Have
the dog-cart round in ten minutes,
Sam, and we dine at seven. Now,
get yourself in marching order, and
I'll tell you the whole story as we go
along."</p>

<p>He did so, but it was so interrupted
by continual expostulations
with his horse, and remarks upon the
country through which we were driving,
that it will be at least as intelligible
if I tell it in my own words;
especially as I had many of the most
graphic passages from Bolton's own
lips afterwards.</p>

<p>It was before he left Oxford, I
think, that Bolton lost his father, and
was thrown pretty much upon his
own resources. A physician with a
large family, however good his practice,
seldom leaves much behind him;
and poor Harry found himself, after
spending a handsome allowance and
something more, left to begin life on
his own account, with a degree, a good
many bills, and a few hundreds, quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
insufficient to pay them. However,
he was not the sort of man to look
upon the dark side of things; and no
heir, long expectant, and just stepping
into his thousands per annum, carried
away from the university a lighter
heart and a merrier face than Harry
Bolton. He got ordained in due
course; and though not exactly the
material out of which one would prefer
to cut a country curate, still he
threw off, with his sporting coats and
many-coloured waistcoats, most of
the habits thereto belonging, and less
suited to his profession. To live upon
a curate's stipend he found more difficult;
and being a fair scholar, and
having plenty of friends and connections,
he announced his intention of
"driving," as he called it, a pair of
pupils, whom he might train up in so
much Latin and Greek, and other elements
of general knowledge, (including,
perhaps, a little shooting and gig-driving,)
as they might require for
their matriculations. The desired
youths were soon found; and Harry
entered upon this new employment
with considerable ardour, and a very
honest intention of doing his best.
How the Latin and Greek prospered
is a point in some degree obscure to
present historians; but all the pupils
were unanimous in declaring the wine
to be unexceptionable, and their preceptor's
dogs and shooting first-rate;
in fact, he sustained, with them, as
with the public generally, the reputation
of being one of the heartiest and
best fellows in the world. From the
poorest among his parishioners, to
whom he was charitable above his
means, but who felt almost more than
his gifts the manner of his giving, to
the squire ten miles off, who met his
pleasant face and smile once a-year
at a dinner party, all spoke well of
Harry Bolton. No wonder that his
pupils looked upon him as the very
paragon of tutors, and found their
path of learning strewed with unexpected
flowers. How many scholars
he made is still unknown; but he
made many friends: with the uncalculating
gratitude of youth, all remembered
the pleasant companion
when they might have forgotten the
hard-working instructor: and frequent
were the tokens of such remembrance,
varying with the tastes
of the senders, which reached the
little parsonage by the Oxford coach,
from those who successively assumed
the <i>toga virilis</i>, and became (university)
<i>men</i>. Collars of brawn and
cases of claret were indeed but perishable
memorials; but there came also
whips extravagantly mounted, and
tomes of orthodox divinity in the
soberest bindings, all bearing inscriptions
more or less classical, from his
"<i>quondam alumni</i>." The first named
delicacies were duly passed on, with
Harry's compliments, to grace more
fittingly the tables of some of his hospitable
entertainers; and, in an equally
unselfish spirit, he seldom sat down
alone to any of his literary dainties,
but kept them in honourable state on
his most conspicuous bookshelf, for the
use and behoof of any friend who
might wish to enjoy them.</p>

<p>But here I am anticipating. For
some time the pupilising went on
pretty smoothly. Two or three
couple of youths were fairly launched
upon the university, and nothing particularly
untoward had occurred to
ruffle the curate's good-humour or
injure his reputation. There had
been no attempt at elopement with
the cook or housemaid&mdash;(Bolton's
precaution had secured ugly ones;) no
poaching on Sir Thomas's favourite
preserve, though close at hand, and
sportsmen of eighteen are not overnice
in their distinctions: a tall Irishman
had been with him, summer vacations
and all, for nearly two years,
and had <i>not</i> made love to either of
the squire's undeniably pretty daughters.
In short, the pupils were less
of a bore than Harry had supposed it
possible, and, in some cases, very
agreeable companions to enliven the
occasional dulness of a country parish.</p>

<p>But somehow or other, in one chief
point which he had aimed at, he found
himself disappointed. In counting so
many additional hundreds to his scanty
income, Harry Bolton had fancied he
was going to make himself a rich
man. He was not avaricious, or even
selfish&mdash;far from it; but he wanted to
be independent; there were visions,
perhaps, flitting indistinctly before
him, of a time when he might tire of
a solitary home, and resign into some
fair and gentle hand the reins of the
liberty he was so fond of boasting as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
bachelor. He did not grudge his time
or labour; he had cast off much of his
old habit of idleness, and took a real
interest in his pupils; still he had
expected some of the results to himself
would take the tangible shape of
pounds shillings and pence. But
though the cheques came duly in at
midsummer and Christmas, the
balance at his banker's increased but
very slowly; in short, he found that
the additional expenses, necessary
and unnecessary, entailed upon him
by the change in his establishment,
nearly counterbalanced the additional
income. Not to speak of such ordinary
matters as butchers' and bakers'
and wine-merchants' bills&mdash;for his
table was always most liberal, now
that he had to entertain others, as it
had been simple and economical while
alone&mdash;indeed the hospitality of the
neighbourhood had then made his
housekeeping almost a sinecure; but
independently of this, Harry had been
led to extend his expenses&mdash;he said
unavoidably&mdash;in other directions. A
rough pony had hitherto contented
him to gallop into the neighbouring
town for letters, and to carry him and
his valise to the dinner-parties even
of his most aristocratic entertainers.
But now, inasmuch as sometimes an
hospitable invitation extended itself
to "the young men," he had felt in
duty bound, for his and their joint
accommodation, to replace the pony
by a showy-looking mare, and to
invest the legal sum of nineteen pounds
nineteen shillings and sixpence in the
purchase of a dog-cart. As an almost
necessary consequence, the boy "Jim"
gave way to a grown-up groom, who
did, rather less work for considerably
more wages, hissing and whistling
over the said mare and dog-cart in
the most knowing manner, and condescending,
though with some scruples
of conscience, to clean boots and
knives. Harry's reminiscences of his
more sporting days were yet fresh
enough for him to make a point of
seeing his turn-out "look as it ought
to do." Jim and the pony, and all
their accoutrements, were rough, and
useful, and cheap, and made no pretensions
to be otherwise. Now, things
were changed, and saddlery and harness
of the best (there was no economy,
as Harry observed, in buying a poor
article) found their place among the
bills at Christmas. In short, he was
led into a maze of new wants, individually
trifling, but collectively sufficient
to tell upon his yearly expenditure;
and he was beginning gravely
to attempt to solve that universal
problem&mdash;the asses' bridge, which the
wisest domestic economists stick fast
at year after year&mdash;"where the deuce
all the money goes to?"&mdash;when circumstances
occurred which put all
such useless inquiries out of his head,
and indeed put his debtor and creditor
transactions on a much more primitive
footing.</p>

<p>In the final settlement of the accounts
of one of his pupils, who was
leaving him for the university, some
misunderstanding arose between himself
and the father. The sum in
question was but a few pounds; but
the objection was put forward in a
manner which Bolton considered as
reflecting upon his own straightforward
and liberal dealing; and it
so happened that the young man had,
from circumstances, been indebted in
an unusual degree to his kindness.
He therefore, I have no doubt, took
the matter up warmly; for those who
remember him as I do, can well
imagine how his blood would boil at
anything he considered mean or unhandsome.
It ended in his insisting
on the whole amount&mdash;a hundred or
so&mdash;respecting which the difference
had arisen, being paid in to the
treasurer of the county hospital instead
of to himself; and he vowed
silently, but determinedly, to renounce
pupilising thenceforth for ever. In
vain did some of his best friends persuade
him to change his resolution;
he kept two who were with him at
the time for a few months, when they
also were to enter college; but he
steadily refused any other offers: he
sold off at once all his superfluous
luxuries, and, as soon as practicable,
gave up his curacy, and quitted the
neighbourhood, to the general regret
of all who knew him, and to the
astonishment of all but the very few
who were in the secret.</p>

<p>When Bolton's friends next heard
of him, he was living in a remote district
of H&mdash;&mdash; shire, on an income necessarily
very small; for it could have
been scarcely more than the proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of his curacy; and curacies in that
part of the country were then but a
wretched provision for any man&mdash;especially
for one accustomed as he
had been to good living and good
society. However, he was not much
troubled with the latter in his present
position; not to speak of the fact that
his nearest conversible neighbour
lived seven miles off. Wherever
parsons are mostly poor, and many
of them ill-educated, they are not
thought much of, either by farmers
or gentlemen. And as it did not
suit Harry's tastes to enjoy his
pipe and pot in the society of the first,
as his predecessor had done with much
contentment, nor yet to wait for the
arrival of the one landed proprietor in
the parish before he commenced the
morning service, he was voted by the
overseers and churchwardens to be
"mighty set up," and by the squire
to be "a d&mdash;&mdash; d unmannerly fellow."
Both indeed soon found out that they
were wrong; and the farmers had the
grace to confess it, and came, in
course of time, to believe it possible
for a curate to be a gentleman without
being proud, and that it was at least
as well for him to be visiting the
sick and poor, and overlooking the
parish school, and able to give a little
good advice to themselves in matters
of difficulty, as to be boozing in their
company at the Crown and Thistle.
And, in course of time, those rough
but honest people came to respect him
almost as much perhaps, in their way,
as his more enlightened neighbours
had done in his former position. It
must have been a great change, however,
to a man like Bolton, used to
good society, fond of it, and readily
welcomed in it, as he had always
been. No doubt he felt it; yet he
declared that, after the first few weeks,
he never was happier in his life. His
gun was given up, as an indulgence
too expensive, but there was excellent
trout fishing for miles on both
sides of his cottage; and, though a
sport to which he had no great liking
in his earlier days, he now took to it
vigorously as the only amusement at
hand, and became no unworthy disciple
of honest Isaac. The worst
effect of this new life of isolation was,
that he became somewhat negligent in
his habits; took to smoking a great
deal, and made his tobacconist's
account a good deal longer than his
tailor's. He had still many old
friends and connections at a distance,
with whom he might have spent half
the year if he had pleased; but, in his
first pique with the world in general,
he had fixed himself purposely as far
out of their reach as possible; travelling
was expensive (railways as yet
were not); assistance in his clerical
duties was not easily obtained; and
so, partly from choice, and partly from
necessity, his new life became one of
almost utter isolation.</p>

<p>Of course there were occasions
when he found it necessary to visit
the neighbouring market-town&mdash;if it
could be called neighbouring when it
was twelve miles off. The main road
lay about a mile from Harry's little
cottage, and a coach, passing daily,
would usually deposit him safely in
the High Street in the course of the
forenoon&mdash;allowing an hour for waiting
for it at the crossing, (it was always
after its time,) and about two
more, if the roads were not unusually
heavy, for getting over the distance.
It was not a very luxurious style of
travelling; and Harry often preferred
to walk in one day, and return the
next. It was on one of these rare
visits that a soaking rain discouraged
him from setting out for home on foot,
and gave the Regulator the unusually
full complement of one inside and one
outside passenger. On the box was
our friend Harry, inside a rather precise-looking
personage, whose costume,
as far as a large cloak allowed
it to be seen, looked somewhat more
clerical than the Curate's, the latter
being clad in a smart upper benjamin
of the landlord's of the Swan, finished
round the throat with a very gay
shawl of his daughter's, both forced
upon him in consideration of the
weather; for Harry, though by no
means a frequent, was a highly favoured
guest, and they would sooner have
kept him in No. 1 for a week gratis,
than have allowed him to turn out in
the rain without due protection.</p>

<p>Slower than usual that day was the
Regulator's progress through the mud
and against the wind, and briefer than
usual its driver's replies to Harry's
good-humoured attempts at conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who have we inside, do you
know, Haines?"</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon it's what you'd
call a hopposition coach like," grunted
out Joe Haines.</p>

<p>"Eh? I don't exactly understand."</p>

<p>"Why, I mean a Methodist bishop,
or summat o' that sort. You see
there was a great opening of the Independent
College here o' Tuesday,
and there was a lot o' them gentry
about the town, looking too good to
live. I druv' five on 'em down yesterday,
and they gev' me a shilling
and a fourpenny amongst the whole
lot. Oh! I loves them sort, don't I
just?" and Joe gave his near wheeler
a cut, illustrative of his affection. It
was a longer speech than he had made
all the way, and he relapsed into a
gloomy silence.</p>

<p>The wind was driving right into
their teeth, and the evening closing
fast, and they were passing the last
mile-stone to the turning without any
farther attempt at conversation, when
there came first an ominous crack
from under their feet, then a jolt, an
unsteady wavering motion for a few
seconds, when, with scarcely time for
an exclamation, the coach toppled
over on one side, and Bolton found
himself reclining on the portly person
of Mr Joseph Haines, who, in his
turn, was saved from contusions by a
friendly heap of mud by the road-side.
Beyond a broken axle, however, no
damage was done. The horses were
glad of any opportunity to stand still.
Bolton got up, shook himself, and
laughed. Joe Haines was proceeding
to philosophise rather strongly on the
accident, not exactly after the manner
of Job or Seneca, when the inside
passenger, putting his head out of the
only practicable window, begged him
to spare his oaths, and help him out
of his prison.</p>

<p>The stranger was soon extricated,
and the horses taken out; and the
driver, requesting his passengers to
await his return, set off to seek assistance
at the nearest cottage. As to the
coach itself proceeding farther until
partially repaired, that was evidently
out of the question; and so Harry observed
to his companion, who did not
appear very knowing in such matters.</p>

<p>"And how far may we be from
S&mdash;&mdash;, sir?" inquired he, upon
receiving this not very agreeable
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Fifteen miles at least," replied
Bolton.</p>

<p>"Indeed, so far! and is there no
place near where I could procure a
conveyance of any kind? I have an
engagement there I particularly wished
to keep to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Really, I fear not; this is quite
an out-of-the-way place: the driver
can tell you better than I can, but I
know the neighbourhood pretty well,
and think you would have to send
back to the Swan at B&mdash;&mdash; for
horses."</p>

<p>"It is very unfortunate, and it is
past nine already; what is the nearest
place, sir, where I could get decent
accommodation for the night?"</p>

<p>"Why, the nearest place," said
Harry, hesitatingly, "is the 'Crown
and Thistle,' about three miles off,
but I can't say much for the accommodation.
Wo-ho,"&mdash;one of the
horses, tired at last of standing in
the drizzling rain, was showing symptoms
of an immediate return to his
stable. The stranger merely gave
vent to a dissatisfied "Humph!"
and they stood silently awaiting the
approach of a light along the road,
which betokened Joe's return with
assistance. The coach was soon
righted, and set up against the side of a
bank; and Mr Haines, having given
charge to one of his aids-extraordinary
to keep watch by it till dawn with a
light, both to prevent accidents and
abstraction of the luggage, announced
his intention of returning with the
horses to B&mdash;&mdash;, offering to his inside
passenger the choice of a ride
back, or taking a nap in the coach
till morning. "<i>You</i> won't be long
getting home, Mr Bolton, anyhow,"&mdash;and
the pronoun was emphasised, to
show that even this sympathy was
little extended to his fellow-traveller.</p>

<p>"No, Joe, I must say you have
been pretty considerate: as you <i>were</i>
to break down, you could hardly have
arranged it more handily for me.
Just look me out my little carpet-bag,
and I suppose you'll expect an extra
shilling for your performance to-night,
eh?"</p>

<p>Joe gave a hoarse laugh, and proceeded
to rummage the boot; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Harry took advantage of the opportunity
to whisper a few inquiries
about his fellow-passenger.</p>

<p>"Well, I be pretty sure, sir, it's a
Dr Bates, as preached at the opening
on Tuesday. There was two or three
black coats came with him to the yard
afore we started; he's quite a top-sawyer
among 'em, and can hold on
for two hours good, best pace, they
tell me. He's giv' out to preach over
at S&mdash;&mdash; to-morrow morning. I
see'd the printed bills stuck all over
town to-day."</p>

<p>To-morrow was Sunday; and Bolton
thought of a certain manuscript,
not quite finished, lying on his desk
at home. He glanced again at the
stranger, and possibly, in the orthodoxy
of his heart, did not feel particularly
grieved at the disappointment
probably in store for the itching ears
of the S&mdash;&mdash; non-conformists.</p>

<p>"Well, good night, Haines," said he.
But seeing his late companion still
standing in the road, looking rather
helpless, and hesitating to leave him
altogether to the tender mercies of the
coachmen, "I am walking in the
direction of the village inn," he continued,
"and if I can show you the
way, I shall be very glad to do so. I
dare say I can also find some one to
fetch your luggage."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said the other,
"I cannot do better than follow your
example;" and he at once selected
and shouldered, with some activity for
a man obviously on the wrong side of
forty, a carpet-bag of more cumbersome
dimensions than Bolton's; and
they strode down the road together,
nearly in darkness, and with the rain
still falling.</p>

<p>They had nearly reached the curate's
humble cottage, without much further
conversation, when the stranger repeated
his inquiries as to the distance
to the inn, and the probability of his
obtaining there any tolerable accommodation.
"A <i>clean</i> bed," he said,
"would content him; was he likely
to find one?"</p>

<p>A struggle had been going on, from
the time they left the coach, between
Harry Bolton's good-nature, and what
he thought his due dignity. Every
word his fellow-passenger had uttered
had convinced him, more and more,
that he was a man of education and
good sense, to say the least; a totally
different being from the class of whom
Jabez Green, who expounded at
Mount Pisgah in his own parish on
Sundays, and did a little shoemaking
and poaching on week-days, formed a
specimen ever before his eyes; and if
it had not seemed a ludicrous misapplication
of hospitality to have entertained
the great gun of schism within
the lares of the "<i>persona ecclesia</i>," he
would long ago have offered the very
respectable and mild-mannered gentleman,
dropped by an unlucky accident
almost at his door, at least a good
fire, and a pair of clean sheets for the
night. Sleep at the Crown and
Thistle! why, on consideration, it
was scarcely creditable to himself to
send him there. The landlord was one
of the most disreputable fellows in the
parish, and, by ten o'clock on a Saturday
night, was usually so drunk as to
be more likely to refuse a guest any
accommodation at all, than to take
any extra pains for him. And the
dirt, and the noise, and the etceteras!
No, Dr Bates had better have stuck
to the inside of the coach than have
tried the Crown and Thistle. But
where else was he to go? There was
a good spare bedroom, no doubt, at
Barby farm, within half-a-mile; but
it had not been occupied since Harry
had slept in it himself on his first
arrival in the parish, and then it took
a week's notice to move the piles of
wool and cheese, and have it duly
aired. The stranger coughed. Harry
grew desperate, and spoke out.</p>

<p>"We are close to my little place
now, sir. I think I can offer you what
you will hardly find at the inn&mdash;a
clean room and a well-aired bed; and
it seems a mere act of common civility
to beg you to accept it."</p>

<p>With many thanks, but with the
natural politeness and ease with which
a gentleman receives from another the
courtesy which he is always ready to
offer himself, the hospitable invitation
was at once freely accepted; and in
five minutes they had passed the little
gate, and were awaiting the opening
of the door.</p>

<p>This service was performed by the
whole available force of Harry's establishment.
One active little elderly
woman, who was there on resident
and permanent duty, in all capacities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
assisted on this occasion by Samuel
Shears, parish clerk, sexton, barber,
bird-fancier, fishing-tackle maker, &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c.; and acting gardener, valet,
butler, and footman, when required,
to the reverend the curate. Loud was
the welcome he received from both.
"Had he walked through all the rain,
sure<i>ly</i>! The coach was very late
then; they'd 'most given him up:
no, Sam hadn't, 'cause of service to-morrow;"
when their volubility was
somewhat checked by the sight of his
companion; and the old lady's face
underwent no very favourable change
when informed she must prepare a
second bed.</p>

<p>"Walk in, pray, and warm yourself&mdash;that
room&mdash;Sam, take these
bags;" and Harry stepped aside into
the kitchen, to negotiate with his
housekeeper for the stranger's accommodation;
a matter not to be effected
but by some little tact: for Molly,
like servants of higher pretensions,
did not like being put out of her way,
by people "coming tramping in," as
she said, at all hours of the night;
and if Bolton had replied to her close
inquiries, as to who and whence the
new guest was, with the statement
that he was a stray Methodist
preacher, it is probable that Molly,
who had lived with clergymen since
she was a child, and would sooner
have missed her dinner than "her
church," would have resigned her
keys of office at once in high disgust.</p>

<p>"The gentleman will sleep in my
room, of course, Molly, and I shall
have my things put into the other;&mdash;anything
will do for supper&mdash;bread
and cheese, Molly, quite well&mdash;toast
a little, will you? Poor man, he seems
to have a cough."</p>

<p>"Toasted cheese a'n't good for a
cough."</p>

<p>"No; to be sure not. Well, you
can fry a little bacon, and a few eggs,
you know."</p>

<p>"There a'n't no eggs. I don't know
what's come to the 'ens: they behaves
'orrid, they does."</p>

<p>"Well, anything, anything, Molly.
I'm very tired, and I don't care
what it is: we shall both be very glad
to get to bed."</p>

<p>"Lor, I dare say you be tired,
sir," said Molly, somewhat pacified.
"You've had a very wet ride, to be sure;
lawk-a-me, why this coat might be
a-wringed out." And she hastened to
relieve her master of some of his outer
wrappings, and supply him with a warm
dressing-gown and slippers, in which
he soon joined his guest in the little
parlour; and having introduced him
to the room he was to occupy for the
night, left him also to make himself
comfortable.</p>

<p>If Harry Bolton did not repent of
his hospitality, which would have been
very unlike him, yet, upon consideration,
he certainly felt he was acting
the good Samaritan somewhat more
literally than he had ever expected to do.</p>

<p>"What on earth shall I do with
him to-morrow, I should like to
know?" was the first question that
suggested itself&mdash;much more readily
than did the answer. He could not
be expected to go to church, perhaps;
but would he stay quietly at home?
or walk off to assist the very reverend
Jabez at Mount Pisgah? As to his
keeping his appointment at S&mdash;&mdash;, that
at least was out of the question; and,
after all, there seemed so much good
sense and feeling of propriety about
the traveller, that it was most probable&mdash;at
least Harry thought so&mdash;that
he would not in any way offend
against the rules of the household
which he had entered under such circumstances.</p>

<p>So the curate brushed the clinging
rain from his hair, and the cloud from
his brow, with one and the same motion,
and relapsed into his usual state
of good-humour. Supper came in, and
he and his guest sat down opposite to
each other, and prepared to discuss
old Molly's simple cookery. Really,
now that one could look at him well,
the man was very presentable in person
as well as in manner. Harry said
grace in a very few words, and the
other's "Amen" was audible and
unexceptionable; reverent, and not
nasal. He had a capital appetite:
it was said to be characteristic of his
calling, but in that point Harry fully
kept pace with him; and the conversation
was not, for the present, a very
lively one. Sam came in at last to
take away.</p>

<p>"Sam," said the curate in a half-aside,
"<i>is</i> there a bottle of port?&mdash;here's
the key."</p>

<p>"La! sir, you bid me take it down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
to old Nan, you know; and it wor the
last bottle, I tell'd you then."</p>

<p>"Ha! so I did, so I did. Did she
like it, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Like it?" said Sam, opening his
eyes, "I warrant her!"</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, I hope it did her
good;&mdash;never mind. You must fare
as I do, I am afraid," said he to the
other. "Bring out the whisky-jar,
Sam."</p>

<p>Bolton mixed himself a glass without
further preface or apology; and
his neighbour, with the remark that it
could not be much amiss after a wetting,
very moderately followed his
example.</p>

<p>"And now," said Bolton, rummaging
in a little cupboard behind
him, "I hope you don't dislike the
smell of tobacco. I'm rather too fond
of it myself. My weakness is a pipe:
I could find you a cigar, perhaps, if
you are ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I never do smoke;
but pray do not mind me: I was at a
German university for a year and a
half, and that is a pretty fair apprenticeship
to cloud-raising."</p>

<p>Took a doctor's degree there, no
doubt, thought Harry; but it served
excellently as an opening for general
conversation; and two pipes had been
consumed, and Molly had twice informed
the gentlemen that the beds
were all ready, and that Sam was
waiting to know if there were any
orders for to-morrow, before Harry
remembered that he had a sermon
still to finish, and that it was verging
upon Sunday morning&mdash;so intelligent
and agreeable had been the discourse
of the stranger.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said the clerk,
putting his head in at the door, "the
rain is a-coming down like nothing,
and that great hole over the pulpit
ben't mended yet. Master Brooks
promised me it should be done afore
to-night; but he's never seen to it."</p>

<p>"That Brooks is the very&mdash;but,
there, it can't be helped to-night, Sam,
at all events," said Bolton, rather
ashamed that the defects of his parochial
administration should be exposed,
as it were, to the enemy. "I
must speak to him about it myself."</p>

<p>"I clapped a couple of sods over it
as well as I could, sir," said the persevering
Sam; "and I don't think much
wet can come in to hurt, like. Will
this gentleman 'ficiate to-morrow?&mdash;(this
was in a loud confidential whisper)&mdash;'cause
the t'other surplice
a'n't"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't bother now&mdash;there's a good
fellow," said Harry, considerably annoyed,
as he shut the door in the face
of his astonished subordinate, who
was generally privileged to gossip as
much as he pleased. He covered his
embarrassment by showing his visitor
at once to his room, and then sat
down to complete his own preparations
for the next day's duties.</p>

<p>The rain was as busily falling in
the morning as if it had only just begun,
instead of having been at it all
night. Harry had been more than
usually scrupulous in his dress; but
when they met at the breakfast table,
his guest's clerical <i>tout-ensemble</i> beat
him hollow. After a rather silent
meal, in which both, as if by tacit
consent, avoided all allusion to subjects
connected with the day and its
duties, Bolton mustered his courage,
as they rose from table, to say&mdash;"My
service is at eleven, and I shall have
rather a wet walk; you, perhaps, are
not disposed to accompany me?"</p>

<p>"By all means," said the stranger,
bowing; "I am quite ready;&mdash;is it
time to set out?" And in a few minutes
they were picking their way,
side by side, down the little miry
lane.</p>

<p>The church, it must be confessed,
was not a comely edifice. Its architectural
pretensions must originally
have been of the humblest order; and
now, damp and dilapidated, it was
one of the many which, in those days,
were a disgrace to any Christian community.
There was the hole in the
roof, immediately over the curate's
head, imperfectly stopped by Sam's
extempore repairs; and very wretched
and comfortless did the few who composed
the congregation look, as they
came dripping in, and dispersed themselves
among the crumbling pews.
The service proceeded, and none
showed such reverent attention as the
stranger; and being placed in the
rectorial pew, immediately opposite
the clerk, the distinct though subdued
tone of his responses was so audible,
and so disturbed that functionary,
(who had that part of the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
usually pretty much to himself, and
had come to consider it as in some
sort his exclusive privilege,) that he
made some terrible blunders in the
hard verses in the Psalms, and occasionally
looked round upon his rival,
on these latter occasions especially,
with unmistakeable indignation.</p>

<p>The service concluded, Bolton found
his guest awaiting him in the porch;
and some ten minutes' sharp walking,
with few remarks, except in admiration
of the pertinacity of the rain,
brought them home again to the cottage.
A plain early dinner was discussed:
there was no afternoon service;
and the curate had just stepped
into his kitchen to listen to some petition
from a parishioner, when the
stranger took the opportunity of retiring
to his own apartment, and did
not reappear until summoned to tea.</p>

<p>Bolton's visit to the kitchen had
interrupted a most animated debate.
In that lower house of his little commonwealth,
the new arrival had been
a fruitful topic of discussion. The
speakers were three; Molly, Sam,
and Binns the wheelwright, who had
looked in, as he said, on a little business
with the parson. Molly, as has
been said, was a rigid churchwoman.
Her notions of her duty in that capacity
might not have been unexceptionable,
but they were, so far as the
Sunday went, as follows:&mdash;Church in
the morning and afternoon, if practicable,
as much reading as her eyes&mdash;not
quite what they used to be&mdash;could
comfortably manage; pudding for
dinner, and tea and gossip in the
evening. If fine, a walk would have
come among the day's arrangements;
but with the rain coming down as it
did, and after having rather puzzled
herself with a sermon upon the origin
of evil, the sudden, and in a degree
mysterious, visit of a strange gentleman&mdash;where
visitors of any kind were
so rare&mdash;became invaluable as a topic
of interesting&mdash;for aught we know, of
profitable&mdash;discourse. Sam Shears
dined with her always on this day;
and was allowed, not without scruples,
to have his pipe in the chimney-corner;
in consideration of which indulgence,
he felt it his duty to make
himself as agreeable as possible; and
inasmuch as his stock-stories respecting
enormous perch caught, or gifted
starlings educated by him, Samuel
Shears, had long ceased to interest&mdash;indeed
had never much interested&mdash;his
fair listener here, though they still
went down, with variations, at the
Crown and Thistle, he was reduced
very often, in the absence of anything
of modern interest stirring in the
neighbouring town of S&mdash;&mdash;, to keep
up his credit as a "rare good companion,"
by entering into politics&mdash;for
which study, next to divinity, Molly
had a decided taste&mdash;talking about
reforms and revolutions in a manner
that Molly declared made her "creep,"
and varying this pleasurable excitement
by gloomy forebodings with regard
to "Rooshia and Prooshia."</p>

<p>On this particular evening, however,
the subject of debate was of a domestic
nature, and Molly and the clerk had
taken opposite sides: Binns arriving
opportunely to be appealed to by
both, and being a man of few words,
who shook his head with great gravity,
and usually gave a nod of encouragement
to the last speaker. Molly,
after her first indignation at the intrusion
of a wet stranger, without
notice, at ten o'clock of a Saturday
night, had been so softened by the
courteous address and bearing of the
enemy, that she had gradually admitted
him at least to a neutrality;
and when Sam Shears had in confidence
hinted that he "hadn't quite
made up his mind about 'un"&mdash;her
woman's kindness of heart, or her
spirit of contradiction, rushed forth
as to the rescue of a friend.</p>

<p>"I wonder at you, Sam," said she;
"you've had heddication enough to
know a gentleman when you see's him;
and you'd ought to have more respect
for cloth."</p>

<p>"Cloth! There now," replied Sam,
"that's just it; I an't so sure about
his cloth, as you call it."</p>

<p>"Why, what ever do you mean,
Sam Shears?"</p>

<p>"I mean," rejoined Sam boldly,
though he felt that Molly's fiercest
glance was upon him, and almost
choked himself in the endeavour to
hide himself in a cloud of his own
creating&mdash;"I mean, I don't think as
he's a regular parson. If he had been,
you see, he'd have took some of the
duty. Besides," continued the official,
reassured by Binns' respectful atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>tion,
"we had a little talk while we
was a-waiting for master after church&mdash;I
offered him a humbereller, you
see&mdash;and I just asked whereabouts
his church was, and he looked queerish
at me, and said he hadn't no
church, not exactly; and then I
begged his pardon, and said I thought
he was a clergyman; and he said, so
he was, but somehow he seemed to
put me off, as it might be." Binns
nodded.</p>

<p>"To be sure," said Molly, "and
'twas like your manners, Sam, to go
questioning of him in that way."</p>

<p>"Bless you, I was as civil as could
be; however, I say again, I 'as my
doubts: he'd a quakerish-looking coat
too, such as I never see'd on a regular
college parson. He's the very moral
of a new Irvingite preacher."</p>

<p>"And what's their doctrines, Sam?"
asked Molly, whose theological curiosity
was irresistibly excited.</p>

<p>"Why," said the clerk after a puff
or two to collect his thoughts, "they
believes in transmigration."</p>

<p>Binns made a gesture of awe and
abjuration.</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Molly, "that's
popery: nor you don't suppose, Sam,
that master would have anybody
of that sort in his house&mdash;eh, Mr
Binns?"</p>

<p>The benefit of that gentleman's
opinion was lost to both parties, for it
was at that juncture "master" himself
entered, and having discussed his
communication, which related to a
sick wife, bid him call again in the
morning, and the wheelwright took
his leave.</p>

<p>"And now Shears," said the
curate, "(don't put your pipe behind
you, man; do you suppose I have not
smelt it this half hour&mdash;I wish you
would buy better tobacco)&mdash;you must
be off to S&mdash;&mdash; to-morrow at daylight,
and order a chaise to be here, for this
gentleman, by nine o'clock at the
latest. Do you understand, now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, yes. I'll be sure to go.
And what name shall I say, sir?"</p>

<p>"Name, eh! oh, it doesn't matter.
Say for me, of course. And look here:
there will be five shillings for you if
the chaise is here in time. Ay, you
may well make a bow; I told the
gentleman it was too much for you."</p>

<p>"I'm very much obliged to you
both," said Sam slyly, "I'm sure,
sir; I'll be off at cock-crow."</p>

<p>"There, Sam Shears," said Molly,
as soon as they had the kitchen to
themselves again, "did you ever hear
of one of your new what-d'ye-call-ums
ordering a chaise to go ranting
about in, I should like to know? What
have you got to say now?"</p>

<p>"I say," said Sam, "as he's a gentleman,
and no mistake."</p>

<p>The evening passed away very
quietly in the little parlour. The
favourable impression made upon Bolton
by his guest's manners and conversation
was certainly deepened by their
further intercourse: but the position
seemed felt by both parties to be an
awkward one; and when his departure
early on the following morning
was proposed, Bolton of course made
no effort to detain him. Both employed
most of the evening in reading;
and one or two remarks made by the
stranger, as he made his selection from
the curate's library, proved at least
his acquaintance with the works which
it contained, though nothing escaped
him, as he wiped the dust from some
of Harry's presentation volumes,
which could indicate either his agreement
or disagreement with the sound
divines he was handling, and his
clever criticisms were rather those of
the bibliographer than the theologian.
At last he seemed to bury himself in
a volume of old South, and carried
it off with him early to his chamber.</p>

<p>The morning came, and eight o'clock
brought breakfast, and half-past eight
the chaise, with Sam Shears fast
asleep inside of it. The curate and
his guest parted with mutual good-will,
and with a short but warm acknowledgment,
on the part of the
latter, of the hospitality he had received.
Sam was not forgotten; he
received the promised gratuity with
many bows, and did not put his hat
on again until the chaise had fairly
turned the corner.</p>

<p>"Uncommon nice gentleman that,
sir, to be sure," said he to his master,
with whom be seldom missed the
chance of a little conversation, if he
could help it&mdash;and Bolton was generally
good-natured enough to indulge
him&mdash;"uncommon nice gentleman;
what a thousand pities it is he should
be a Methody!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"A <i>what</i>?" inquired the curate, turning
round upon him in ludicrous dismay.</p>

<p>"A Methody preacher, sir," said
Sam boldly; for Harry's countenance
quite confirmed his suspicions. "Oh!
I know all about it, sir; but it ain't
of no account with me, sir, you know,
not none whatever,"&mdash;and he redoubled
his negatives with a confidential
mysteriousness which made
Harry inclined to kick him. "I
met Joe Haines, as drives the Regulator,
this morning, and he asked me very
particular about you, you see, sir, and
how you got home o' Saturday night;
and then I told him as how this gentleman
came with you; and when he
heard as he'd been staying here all
day yesterday, how he did laugh, to
be sure; and then he told me"&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll tell you something, Sam, too.
You had much better mind your own
business, and not trouble yourself to
talk to Joe Haines, or anybody else,
about what goes on in my house."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the fact
that his master was angry: and as
such a thing had very seldom happened
within Sam's experience, it was
a result of which he stood considerably
in awe; and he hastened, with
some confusion, to apologise, and to
resume his praises of the "very nice
gentleman, whatever he was,"&mdash;"And
as you say, sir, that's no business of
mine: I'm sure I should be most happy
to wait upon him at any time, sir"&mdash;</p>

<p>But Bolton had retired, and shut
the door of his little sitting-room in
an unmistakeable manner. So Sam
was obliged to soliloquise the rest of
his apologies, which began to be very
sincere, as he consoled himself by
gazing at the two half-crowns which
had come into his possession so easily.
"Of course; if so be as he's a gentleman,
what matters? That's what I
say: that's what I said to master:
that's what I said to Molly:&mdash;hallo!
hey?&mdash;If this here half-crown ain't a
smasher!"</p>

<p>'Twas too true: it rung upon the
flag-stone like an unadulterated piece
of lead.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now, Sam?"
said Mrs Molly, who heard the sound,
and met his blank face in the passage.</p>

<p>"I told you what he was," said
Sam&mdash;"look here!" Molly examined
the unfortunate coin with, every wish
to give it the benefit of a doubt, but
was obliged finally to pronounce
against it. She had to listen,
also, to the story which Sam had heard
from Joe Haines; and though she
clung pertinaciously to her previously-formed
conclusions in the
stranger's favour, Sam had now decidedly
the best of the argument, which
he clinched at last with what he considered
an unanswerable proposition&mdash;"If
you says as he's a parson and a
gentleman, will you give me two-and-sixpence
for this here half-crown?"</p>

<p>Weeks passed on, and other events
wore out the interest of the stranger's
visit, even in those dull localities. Binns'
wife had a baby; and another piece
of the church roof fell in, and nearly
carried Brooks the churchwarden with
it, as he was mounted on a ladder
estimating its repairs&mdash;for there was
an archdeacon's visitation coming on,
and not even the vulcanised conscience
of a parish functionary could be
brought to pronounce, on oath, its
present state of repair to be good and
sufficient. And Harry received an
invitation to dine with the said archdeacon,
who was a good kind of man
on the whole&mdash;that is, his good qualities
would not very well bear taking
to pieces&mdash;but he rather patronised
the younger clergy in his neighbourhood,
provided that they were young
men of tolerable family, and good
address, and not, as he expressed it,
<i>ultra</i> in any way. It so happened,
that he was almost the only acquaintance
that Harry had made in the
neighbourhood. He had written to
request his interference in enforcing
the repair of the church; and as that
was a compliment seldom paid to his
official dignity, the archdeacon had
actually driven over thirteen miles to
inspect the place personally: and,
arriving quite unexpectedly, had
caught the curate just sallying forth
equipped for fishing&mdash;an art to which
he himself occasionally condescended&mdash;for
even archdeacons do unbend. And
very soon ascertaining that there was
no tendency to an objectionable <i>ultra</i>,
of any kind, in our hero, and that he
was in fact rather an eligible rear-rank
man for a dinner-table, had made a
mental memorandum of the fact, and,
in consequence, had twice favoured
him with an invitation, which Harry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
according to his present humour, had
declined. On this occasion, however&mdash;as
a third refusal would have seemed
ungracious&mdash;he had determined to go;
and, with some compunction at the
expense (he had thought nothing at
Oxford of a hunter, and a "team" to
cover, at about five guineas for the
day,) he, found himself in a hired gig
at the archdeacon's door, a little before
the dinner hour on the day appointed.
None of the guests were as yet assembled.
His host, however, met him in
the drawing-room, and presented him,
with considerable cordiality, to his
lady and her daughters.</p>

<p>"It was very good indeed of Mr
Bolton to come so far to see us,"
said the archdeacon. "Indeed, I am
particularly glad you came to-day,"
continued he with a sort of pompous
kindness, "for I have the bishop
staying here, and I wished you to
meet him."</p>

<p>Harry was interrupted in his acknowledgments
by the entrance of two
men of the expected party: the Honourable
and Reverend Mr Luttridge,
a young man, who eyed his brother
curate, on his introduction, with
what he intended for a critical and
interrogative glance, but which had
by no means the effect upon that
party which he intended; and another
archdeacon, or dean, or some
such dignitary, who made Bolton a
very low bow indeed; and, turning
his back upon him forthwith, began
to discourse with the other two upon
the business of the last Petit Sessions.
A discussion upon some point of
magisterial law was interrupted by a
burst of shrill and hearty laughter
from the younger of Misses Archdeacons&mdash;a
fat merry girl, with whom
Harry had struck up an acquaintance
instantly&mdash;<i>that</i> was a point he never
failed in; and although the other two
gentlemen looked rather astonished,
and turned round again to resume
their argument, the father&mdash;she was
his favourite daughter, and ludicrously
like him&mdash;was delighted to see her
amused, and insisted upon knowing
what the fun was between them.
Some absurd remark of Harry's was
repeated, as well as her continued
merriment would allow her; and the
archdeacon, after a preparatory shaking
of his sides, had just burst into a
stentorian "ha-ha," when the drawing-room
door again opened, and the
Bishop of F&mdash;&mdash; was most audibly
announced.</p>

<p>Every one tried to look deferential,
of course; and the two gentlemen in
front of Harry separated, and took
open order to receive his lordship.
Everybody recovered their propriety,
in fact, in an instant, except Miss
Harriet, to whom a bishop was no
treat at all&mdash;not to be compared with
an amusing young curate. She kept
her eyes fixed upon Harry Bolton&mdash;she
thought he was going to faint.
Could it be possible?&mdash;oh! there was
no doubt about it. Schismatic Doctor
Bates, or Bishop of F&mdash;&mdash;, there he
was!&mdash;there was the man he had
walked home in the rain with!</p>

<p>Harry's quondam guest walked forward
with an easy grace, which contrasted
strikingly with the stiff dignity
of his subordinates. He shook hands
politely with Mr Luttridge, and returned
the greeting of his companion
somewhat more warmly. The archdeacon
was preparing to introduce
Bolton, without noticing his embarrassment,
when the bishop anticipated
the introductory speech by saying,
as he held out his hand, "Mr Bolton
and I are old friends&mdash;may I not say
so?"</p>

<p>A man of less self-possession than
our friend the curate might have been
put quite at his ease by the kind tone
and manner, and warm grasp of the
hand. "Certainly," was his reply,
"your lordship and myself <i>have</i>
met, under rather different circumstances."</p>

<p>The archdeacon's respectable face
expressed considerable astonishment,
as well it might; and the other two
gentlemen began to eye his lordship's
"old friend" with interested and inquisitive
glances.</p>

<p>"My dear archdeacon," said the
bishop, laughing, "pardon my mystification;
this is the friend with whom I
spent a day or two on my last visit to
this neighbourhood, when you really
thought you had lost me altogether;
though, if you had told me I was to
have the pleasure of meeting him at
your table to-day, I might, perhaps,
have let you into the secret."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Bolton," said the
host&mdash;he had dropped the Mr at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
and for ever&mdash;" why did you not tell
me that you knew his lordship?&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Harry laughed, and got a little confused
again; but the bishop answered
the question for him, before he had
time to frame an intelligible reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a long story; but it
was no mystery of Mr Bolton's, be
assured. I am afraid, indeed, it will
tell rather better for him than, for me;
but I promise you the explanation,
someday," continued the bishop, good-humouredly,
"when we have nothing
better to talk about." The archdeacon
took the hint, and turned the conversation.
Another guest or two joined
the party; dinner succeeded, and
passed off much as such affairs usually
do. The bishop, although he did not
address much of his conversation
directly to Bolton, took care to make
him feel at his ease; and Mr Luttridge,
who sat next to him, became remarkably
friendly&mdash;was quite surprised that
he had not heard of him before, being,
in fact, quite a near neighbour&mdash;only
nine miles&mdash;nothing at all in that part
of the country&mdash;should ride over to
call on him one of the first days he
could spare&mdash;and, in fact, said what
became him to say to the bishop's
friend and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever curiosity might have been
felt on the subject by the rest of the
company, it was not until they had
taken their departure that the bishop
thought proper to explain to Bolton
and the archdeacon the circumstances
which had led to his paying an incognito
visit to the former. He had only
lately been appointed to the diocese,
and was therefore personally known
to but few of his clergy. The archdeacon
and himself, however, were
old college acquaintances, and he had
accepted an invitation to spend a few
days with him, at the time of his
casual meeting with Harry Bolton.
Being averse at all times to any kind
of ceremony or etiquette, which he
could reasonably dispense with, it had
been arranged that the archdeacon's
carriage should meet him at B&mdash;&mdash;, to
which place his own had conveyed
him. Upon his arrival in the town
somewhat before the hour appointed,
he had, according to his custom,
walked out quietly to make himself
acquainted with the localities, and
had unconsciously passed some hours
in exploring some ruins at a little
distance. Meanwhile, the archdeacon,
not so punctual as his diocesan, drove
up to the hotel door in hot haste, considerably
too late for his appointment,
and was saluted with the unpleasant
information that his lordship had been
there, and was gone on these two
hours,&mdash;for his previous orders had
been duly obeyed, and the episcopal
equipage, with a portly gentleman inside,
who sustained the dignity of his
position as chaplain very carefully,
had really rolled away on its road
homeward. The archdeacon doubted,
but mine host was positive; and
strengthened his position by the assertion
that his lordship had said he was
going to Bircham rectory, a piece of
intelligence picked up from the servants,
with exactly enough truth in
it to do mischief. Off went the archdeacon
again, annoyed at his own
dilatoriness; and great was his consternation
on reaching home to find
no bishop; and great was the bishop's
surprise, on returning at last to the
hotel, to find no archdeacon; and
great the confusion throughout the
Kings Arms; the landlord throwing
the blame upon the waiters, and the
waiters upon each other. Post-horses
to S&mdash;&mdash;, which was within a short
three miles of the archdeacon's rectory,
were ordered at once. But, alas!
after many delays and apologies, none
were to be had; almost every quadruped
in the town was engaged in
taking parties home from the opening
of the Independent College. The
bishop was not a man to make difficulties;
so, leaving his only remaining
servant to await any remedial
measures which the archdeacon might
take when he discovered his error,
and to give an intelligible account of
his movements, he himself, without
mentioning his intention to any other
person, walked down to the coach-office
at the Swan, paid his fare, and
became an inside passenger by the
Regulator.</p>

<p>Of course, when the archdeacon
discovered his mistake, no time was
lost in procuring fresh horses, and
sending back the carriage to B&mdash;&mdash;, in
the hope that his lordship might still
be forthcoming; but it brought back
to the anxious expectants at the rectory
only a servant and, a portman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>teau;
and as they did not pass the
spot where the accident occurred, and
all inquiries made at S&mdash;&mdash; only resulted
in the intelligence that "there had
been an upset, that no one was hurt,
and that the passengers had walked
home," they made up their minds to
await some accurate information as to
his lordship's whereabouts from himself,
when he relieved his friends
from their uncomfortable suspense by
making his appearance personally at
breakfast on the Monday morning;
though, to punish, as he jokingly said,
the archdeacon, for leaving him in
such a predicament, he would tell
them nothing more than that he had
spent the Sunday very pleasantly
with a friend.</p>

<p>Much amusement ensued at the
bishop's details of his visit, though he
good-naturedly avoided any allusions
that could possibly be embarrassing to
his late host. Bolton had accepted
the offer of a bed, and it was late
before they separated for the night.
Before he took his leave on the following
morning, the bishop, to his surprise,
announced his intention of paying
him a second visit. "I think, Mr
Bolton," said he, "that, having intruded
upon you once in disguise, as
I may say, I am bound to come and
preach for you some Sunday, if it be
only to clear my own character in
the eyes of your parishioners," (for
Harry had confessed, to the exceeding
amusement of all parties, his own
and his clerk's suspicions.) "So, if
you please, and if my good friend
here will accompany me, we will
drive over to you next Sunday morning;
and I'll try," continued the bishop
slyly, "if I cannot get Mr Churchwarden
Brooks to put your church a
little to rights for you."</p>

<p>The morning arrived, and the
archdeacon and the bishop. A proud
woman had Molly been from the
moment the announcement was made
to her of the intended honour; and
the luncheon which she had prepared
was, considering her limited resources,
something extraordinary.
But when his lordship alighted, and,
catching a sight of her eager face in
the passage, called to her by name,
and addressed her kindly&mdash;and she
recognised the features of the unknown
guest, whom Sam had so
irreverently slandered&mdash;the good old
woman, between shame and gratification,
was quite overcome, and was
wholly unable to recover her self-possession
throughout the day. During
the whole of the service, she
looked at the bishop instead of the
prayer-book, made responses at random,
and was only saved by the
good-natured interference of his lordship's
own man from totally ruining
the luncheon. Of course, the church
was crowded; the sermon was plain
and impressive: and when, after service,
the whole of the rustic congregation,
collected in the churchyard to
see as much as they could of a personage
few of them had ever seen before,
formed a lane respectfully, with their
hats off, for him to pass to the gate,
the bishop, taking off his hat and
claiming their attention for a few
moments, spoke a few words, homely
and audible, approving their behaviour
during the service, and representing
to them the advantages they might
derive from the residence among them
of an exemplary minister, such as he
believed they had at present, and such
as he would endeavour to provide them
with in the possible event of his removal.
And when afterwards he
begged to be introduced to the churchwarden,
and, taking him familiarly by
the arm, walked with him round the
building, pointed out indispensable
repairs, and, without any word of
reproof, explained to him the harm
done by injudicious patching, and put
into his hands a liberal contribution
towards the expenses&mdash;it might have
seemed quite wonderful to those who
either overrate or underrate poor
human nature, how much more popular
a notion, and how much better
understood a bishop was in that
remote village from that time forth.
The landlord of the Crown and Thistle
was quite surprised at the change that
had come over Mr Brooks. He used
to be rather a popular orator on club
nights and other convivial occasions,
taking that economical view of church
dignitaries and their salaries which,
by an amusing euphemism, is called
"liberal" in politics; but subsequently
to this occasion he seldom joined in
these discussions, was seen less frequently
by degrees in the taproom of
the Crown and Thistle, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
regularly at church; and once, when
hard pressed for an opinion by some
of his former supporters, was asserted
to have told them that the Crown and
Thistle took more money out of
people's pockets than ever the bishops
did.</p>

<p>Harry had anticipated much amusement
from Sam Shears' confusion,
when he should encounter, in his full
canonicals, the, bishop of the diocese
in the person of the apocryphal Dr
Bates; but whatever that worthy's
secret discomfiture might have been,
he carried it off wonderfully well, and
met his lordship in the vestry with a
lurking smile in his humble obeisance,
as if he had all along penetrated the
mystery of his incognito. With Molly
in the kitchen, indeed, he had for some
evenings a hard time of it; but a
threat of absenting himself altogether,
which he ventured in some fear of being
taken at his word, had the effect
of moderating her tone of triumph.
Before the bishop left, he called Sam
aside, and presented him with a substantial
token of remembrance; when
Sam took the opportunity of producing,
with many prefaces of apology,
the condemned half-crown, which had
fretted in his pocket ever since.</p>

<p>"Please your lordship's worship
and reverence," said Sam, "this here
ain't a <i>very</i> good half-crown; at least,
I can't pass it noways down here. I
dare say as your lordship's worship
might pass it away easy enough among
your friends, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here, here," said the bishop,
laughing heartily, "here's another for
you, by all means, my man; but
pray excuse my having anything more
to do with the bad one."</p>

<p>Again the bishop parted from his
entertainer with many expressions of
regard, and an invitation to spend
some time with him at his palace,
which Bolton did much to his satisfaction;
and received from him so
much valuable advice and paternal
kindness, that he always considered
the snug living with which, some
months afterwards, he was presented,
one of the least of his obligations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"And that's how Harry Bolton
came to be a neighbour of mine,"
concluded Long Lumley; "and a nice
place he has here, and a capital
neighbour he is."</p>

<p>We discussed the whole story over
Lumley's wine after dinner the next
day, when the Hon. and Rev. Mr
Luttridge, who had since married the
bishop's niece, and was said to have
been a disappointed expectant of the
living given to Bolton, made one of
our party.</p>

<p>"A very odd man, certainly, the
bishop is," was that gentleman's remark;
"very strange, you know, to
go poking about the country in that
kind of way. Scarcely the thing, in
fact, I must say."</p>

<p>"Upon my honour," said Lumley,
"you parsons ought to be better
judges of what is or is not 'the thing'
for a bishop, than I can be; but if the
Bishop of F&mdash;&mdash; is an odd man, I
know, if I had the making of bishops,
I'd look out for a match for him."</p>

<h2>THE DANGERS OF THE COUNTRY.</h2>


<h3>NO. I.&mdash;OUR EXTERNAL DANGERS.</h3>

<p>Among the many remarkable circumstances
which a comparison of
former with present times never fails to
present to an attentive observer, it is
perhaps the most remarkable with
how much accuracy the effects of
great changes in public policy are
predicted by one portion of the community,
and with what entire insensibility
they are regarded by another.
The results of all the chief alterations
in the system of government which
has taken place in our times&mdash;the
Contraction of the Currency, Roman
Catholic Emancipation, the Reform
Bill, Negro Emancipation, Free
Trade, the Repeal of the Navigation
Laws&mdash;were all foretold by their opponents
at the time they were under
discussion, with such accuracy that
their predictions might pass, after the
events had taken place, for a concise
history of their effects. And yet the
whole body of their supporters, embracing
at each period the numerical
majority at least of the most influential
part of the nation, were
absolutely deaf to these warnings;
they ridiculed the authors of them,
disputed their reasonings, impugned
their motives, and were only the
more confirmed in the headlong
course they were pursuing, by the
demonstration which daily experience
was affording of the enormity of their
own error on previous occasions. It
is evident, from these examples, that
Plato's observation is well founded,
and that general ignorance is neither
the greatest social evil, nor the one most
to be dreaded. Prejudice, passion, a
thirst for selfish aggrandisement, are
the real evils which affect society; and
their sway, unhappily, is only rendered
the more powerful with the extension
of knowledge and the progress of
civilisation. They do worse than
conceal the truth: they render men insensible
to it. So obstinately do the
majority of men, when their interests
are supposed to be at stake, or their
passions are inflamed, resist the light of
truth; so resolutely do they disregard
the clearest procession of demonstration;
so prone are they to be led
away by the arts of ambitious men or
the efforts of class interest,&mdash;that it
may be safely concluded that the
greatest national disasters cannot
long be averted when affairs are
under the immediate direction of a
numerical majority; and that their
own folly or infatuation become the
instruments of the Divine judgments
upon mankind.</p>

<p>A memorable example of the truth
of these observations, and of their vast
importance to a society constructed
as it now is in this country, is to be
found in the recent instance of the
Papal Aggression. For above half a
century past, the whole efforts of the
Liberal party in England were directed
to the abolition of religious
distinctions, and, in particular, to
the introduction of the Roman
Catholics into an entire and equal
participation in the power, privileges,
and influence of Protestants. In
vain was it urged by a small but determined
band, headed by Lord Eldon
in one house of Parliament, and Mr
Perceval in another, that however
well-founded the principles of toleration
were in the general case, and
however desirable it might be, if consistent
with security, to abolish all
distinctions founded on differences of
religious belief, yet the opinion of
the great apostle of toleration, Mr
Locke, was well founded, that these
principles could not be safely applied
to the Roman Catholics, because they
formed part of a great foreign religious
power, which formerly boasted
of Great Britain as the brightest jewel
in its crown, which openly aspired to
universal dominion, and would never
cease striving to reunite that splendid
appanage to the Papal dominions.</p>

<p>These observations were generally
disregarded: the names of bigots,
tyrants, illiberals, were constantly
applied to the resolute patriots who
still continued to utter them; concession
after concession to the Roman
Catholics went on; they were admitted
without reserve into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
British Parliament; the titles of
their Bishops were recognised by
Ministers in Ireland and the colonies;
the entire government and patronage
of Ireland were surrendered into
their hands; until at length, in return
for so many acts of condescension, the
Pope deemed it safe to throw off the
mask, and send, for the first time during
three hundred years, a Cardinal to
London, in order to superintend the
partition of England into ecclesiastical
divisions, and the re-establishment of
the Romish worship in every parish
of the realm! <i>Then</i>, and not till
then, the eyes of the nation were
opened: the bubble, which the
Liberals had kept up for half a century,
suddenly burst, and the dormant
strength of the Protestant principle
was awakened to an extent which
outstripped all calculation, and almost
alarmed the most decided opponents
throughout of Papal ambition!
Then, and not till then, the
warning voice of the bigots and illiberals
of former days was recollected:
their oft-derided predictions were
searched out: the streets were placarded
with Lord Eldon's vaticinations;
and the journals which most
openly shaped their course according
to popular feeling, were the first to
insert in capital letters the now fulfilled
prophecies of former Illiberalism.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Another, and not less memorable,
instance of the way in which public
delusions, all but universal, which
have withstood the utmost force of
reason, argument, and experience for
a long course of years, have been
suddenly dispelled by some great fact
which struck the senses of all, and
could no longer be denied, has occurred
in the recent vast and important
change which the discovery of the
gold in California has made on the
currency of this country, and of the
world. For thirty years past it has
been the uniform policy of the British
Government, directed by the pressure of
the money power, and the influence
of realised capital, to augment the
value of realised wealth, by enhancing
its price and cheapening everything
else. To effect this, gold was first
selected as the standard, because it
was the most valuable of the precious
metals; and as its price had for a long
course of years been slowly but
steadily advancing, it was thought,
with reason, that the assumption of it
as the standard could not fail to
enhance the value of realised capital
of every kind, by cheapening the
money-price of all the articles in
which every one else dealt. Next,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>small notes were extinguished, because
they formed a currency commensurate
to the wants of the nation; and consequently
their abundance tended to
raise prices. Then the issue of notes
beyond &pound;32,000,000 in the whole
empire was made to depend on an
amount of gold coin corresponding to
the notes issued being in the coffers of
the banks issuing: in other words, the
currency beyond that limited amount,
not half of what the nation required,
was made entirely metallic. Free
Trade was next introduced, in order
still further to augment the value of
realised wealth, by taking a fourth
from the price of every commodity
which it might purchase, and consequently
depressing to a similar extent
the remuneration of productive industry.
All this was rested on the
plausible plea of maintaining a fixed
and unchangeable standard of value,
and preventing monetary crises, by
having no circulation except what
was based on the most precious of the
precious metals.</p>

<p>This system was adhered to
through a series of disasters directly
owing to its adoption, which would
have destroyed any other nation, and
levelled with the dust any other
people. In vain was it represented
that gold itself was a commodity,
liable to change in price like any other
article of commerce, according as the
supply was or was not equal to the
demand; that to fix a standard price
for it was to cast anchor in the clouds,
and that to make the circulation of
the country depend entirely on the
retention of an article of commerce,
which could not always be retained,
was necessarily to expose it to the
recurrence of the most disastrous
shock to credit. These warnings
were systematically disregarded; the
bullion system was adhered to amidst
the most frightful calamities; and the
nation, as the price of its adoption,
underwent a series of monetary convulsions
beyond anything recorded in
history, and which entailed losses
greatly exceeding in amount the confiscation
and destruction of property
which resulted from the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Where are these dogmas about the
immutability and indestructible value
of the gold standard <i>now</i>? "Efflavit
Deus, et dissipantur." The beneficence
of Providence has come to the
aid of a benighted and suffering
world. As reason had proved inadequate
to withstand the pressure of
interest, the reserves of nature were
let in: the floodgates were opened:
the beneficent stream overspread the
world. A few grains of gold are discovered
in digging a mill-course in
California, and the whole bullion
system is blown into the air. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>labour of a lifetime is undone in a
moment: the citadel of the money
power is blown up by a spark falling
in its own magazine: the island on
which the Bullionists had cast anchor
itself begins to drift along. Farewell
to all their dreams of cheapening
everything: farewell to the boast of
their able and principal organ, that
they had made the sovereign worth
two sovereigns! The sovereign is in
process of becoming only worth half
a sovereign. The ominous intelligence
has been received from Paris that the
English sovereign had declined fourteen
sous in value; Holland has
openly abandoned the gold standard;
France is preparing measures to meet
the altered value of the precious
metals. The Bullionists are struck in
the very heart of their power. True
to their motives, though not to their
principles, they are already in their
journals decrying gold as a standard,
and proposing silver in its stead.
Everything has for a year past been
rising in price in England except
agricultural produce and sugar, still
kept down by the unrestrained importation
of foreign states. For long
it was tried to write down California;
but the gold-dust at length became
too strong for them. The fatal truth
could no longer be concealed, that the
value of money had declined, was
declining, and, as they thought, ought
to be enhanced. But how to do that
was the difficulty, amidst ceaseless
arrivals of gold from California, and an
overflowing treasure in the Bank of
England. They discovered that some
other idea could be formed of a pound
sterling, "than a certain determinate
weight of gold metal." They would
fain have it something of less fleeting
value. The truth is at length apparent
to the nation&mdash;which had been
so long denied and so studiously concealed
by those who were profiting
by the opposite delusion&mdash;that gold,
like every other metal, is a commodity
liable to change in value according
to its plenty or scarcity, and that
it is hopeless to make a fixed
standard of an article which is itself
liable to greater vicissitudes of price
than perhaps any other.</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether examples
of this sort are most fitted to inspire
confidence in the final triumph of the
cause of truth, or despondency as to
the fate of a nation in which error has
been widespread and long continued,
and powerful classes of society are
interested in its being perpetuated.
It is evident that the enormity of
error, the clearness of the demonstration
of its falsehood, the perilous
and even fatal consequences which
may be anticipated from its continuance,
afford no sort of security against
its sway being continued, if an influential
class is interested in its duration.
It is equally clear that the extension
of education, the boasted march of
intellect, the spread of journals, the
number of persons interested in the
termination of a pernicious policy, the
awful consequences which may be
anticipated from its continuance, are
often wholly impotent to rescue a
nation from disaster, it may be ruin,
if the effects of the disastrous system
are not so plain and palpable as to be
obvious <i>to the senses</i> of the whole of
mankind. But while all this is perfectly
clear on the one hand&mdash;and there
is obviously no limit to this long
continuance of the most ruinous error
in the opinions and policy of a particular
nation&mdash;it is equally evident, on
the other, that there is a bar imposed
by Providence to the <i>eternity</i> of error
in the world in general. The laws
of nature <i>at length come to the aid
of truth</i>: some great and decisive
event occurs which renders its effects
palpable to all the people; the whole
fabric of error so studiously upheld,
so anxiously defended, is overturned
in an instant; and mankind, awakening
from the slumbers of half a
century, are astonished only how a
thing so very evident had never before
struck them. They then find, to
their infinite surprise, that all which
has occurred had been clearly foreseen
and distinctly predicted by the
few among them who judged of the
future by the past, and cast their eyes
beyond the interests or passions of
the moment; and that it was not
because truth had not been told to
them, but because <i>they would not listen
to it</i>, that all the calamities they
deplore had been brought upon them.</p>

<p>The circumstances which mainly
contribute to produce this extraordinary
tenacity of error and insensibility
to truth, in the majority of mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
at all times and under all circumstances,
are their general indifference
to <i>distant</i> effects, and their acute sense
of <i>present</i> burdens. If the danger is
obvious and visible to the senses of
all, and, above all, if it threatens immediate
evil to all, the mass of men will
often make incredible, almost superhuman
efforts to avert it. But if it
is distant and contingent only, and
the remedies proposed to guard
against it are attended with present
burdens, however slight, it will in
general be found that it is wholly impossible
to make them do anything to
guard against the impending evils.
In the words of one who knew them
well,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "they prefer any load of infamy,
however great, to any burden
of taxation, however light." They
never will incur present expense to
guard against future danger. It is
for this reason that states in which
the popular voice is all-powerful so
often rush into foreign wars with
scarcely any preparations, and are so
often defeated by nations possessing
far less vigour and fewer resources,
but in whom the wisdom of a monarchical
or aristocratic government
has made an adequate provision in
peace for the contingency of future
hostilities. All the eloquence of Demosthenes,
we know, failed to make
the Athenian people take any steps
to augment the national armaments,
and they got the battle of Ch&aelig;ronea
and subjugation by Philip in consequence.
The English, in 1778, commenced
the contest with their revolted
American colonies with a regular
army of 20,000 men, and they lost
the colonies in consequence: they
began the war with France in 1793
with 40,000 regular soldiers in the
British empire, when their enemy
had 1,200,000 men under arms; and
it cost them a struggle of twenty
years, and six hundred millions of
debt incurred, to get the better of
the necessary consequences of their
infatuation. They starved down the
establishment in India, and forbade
all hostile preparations, even though
it was a dominion won, and which
could only be upheld, by the sword, till
it was brought to the verge of destruction
on the banks of the Sutlej;
and the empire which disposed of the
resources of 80,000,000 of subjects,
owed its extrication from what seemed
unavoidable ruin, only to a strange
and unaccountable retreat of the
enemy, resting on a population of
6,000,000 only, when victory was within
their grasp. The Americans rushed
into a contest with England in 1812
with a fleet of six frigates and an army
of 8000 men; and the consequence was,
that in two years their commerce was
totally destroyed, their capital taken
by a British division of 3500 men,
and the general suffering would in six
months have made the Northern
States break of from the Union, had
not England, weary of fighting and
satiated with glory, sheathed her
sword when the dissolution of the
Union was within her power.</p>

<p>But in addition to this general
cause of delusion and error, which
pervades all states really regulated
by the popular voice, there is another
and a still more powerful one which
occasions and perpetuates the most
ruinous public delusions in an advanced
and complicated state of
society. This arises from the strength
and influence of the classes who become
interested in the perpetuating
of error because they profit by it, and
the impossibility of getting the great
bulk of men to see, among the numerous
causes which are then acting
upon their fortunes, the <i>real ones</i> to
which their sufferings are owing.
They know perfectly when they are
prosperous, and when unfortunate;
but they do not know, and cannot be
brought to see, to what either the prosperity
or adversity is to be ascribed.
If the consequences of a particular line
of policy could be brought before them
by a <i>clear and short</i> process of demonstration&mdash;if
they could see from
whence their suffering in truth comes,
and the arrow, known to have been
discharged from the quivers of
Free Trade and a metallic currency,
could be seen festering in the breast
of every industrious man in the country,
one universal burst of indignation
would arise from one end of the kingdom
to the other. This system, so
profitable to the moneyed rich, so ruinous
to the industrious poor, would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>abolished, amidst shouts of congratulation
from one end of the country to
the other, in a month. But they cannot
be brought to see this; and the
vast riches which the continuance of
this system is daily bringing to the
moneyed classes, enables them to
perpetuate the darkness.</p>

<p>The press in such circumstances
becomes&mdash;what it was in Napoleon's
time in France, from the overwhelming
weight of military power&mdash;what
Madame de Stael feared it would one
day become in all aged communities&mdash;the
most powerful engine for the diffusion
and continuance of error.
The most ruinous systems of public
policy are then pursued with the cordial
support of the <i>millionnaires</i> who
profit by them, with the loud applause
and able assistance of the public
press, who are guided by the requirements
of their subscribers, or directed
by the dictates of their shareholders,
and amidst the supine indifference
or sullen despair of the industrious
classes, who are steeped in misery by
their effects. They see they are
ruined, but they know not how or by
whom; and a large part of the public
press are careful to direct their attention
to any but the right quarter for
redress. In despair at such an accumulation
of distresses, the great bulk
of mankind follow the usual instinct
of the multitude in such cases&mdash;they
fasten upon the seen in preference to
searching for the unseen, and lend a
willing ear to any demagogue of the
day who lays before them plans for a
great reduction of public burdens, by
abandoning nearly the whole means
of the public defence. Thus a perpetual
reduction of our military and
naval armaments, and means of maintaining
our independence or even
existence as a nation, is forced upon
successive Governments, without the
slightest regard to the obvious peril
with which such reductions, with
increasing armaments on the part of
our neighbours, and increasing points
of attack upon the part of ourselves,
<i>must</i> be attended; and the policy
which has impoverished the greater
part of the nation terminates in its
natural result, the destruction of the
nation itself. Such is the most common
process of national ruin.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the day
will one day come when all these
illusions will be dispelled. If a Russian
fleet of twenty-five ships of the
line anchors off the Nore, and demands
the surrender of the arsenal of
Woolwich, and of our ships of war at
Portsmouth and Plymouth, as the
condition of their raising the blockade
of the capital or saving it from pillage&mdash;or
if a French squadron of fifteen
ships of the line takes a <i>second</i> look
into Torbay, and we have only three
or four half-manned seventy-fours to
oppose to them&mdash;or if an invading army
of 80,000 men lands on the coast of
Sussex, and we can only muster
30,000 regular troops to stop their
progress&mdash;if Woolwich is taken, and
Hyde Park is the scene of an enemy's
camp, and London, like Paris, capitulates
to the conqueror&mdash;or if Russia
and America unite together and demand
the surrender of the half of our
fleet and the whole of our arsenals
as the price at which they will allow
their grain-laden vessels to come to
Great Britain and restore bread to the
7,000,000 of our population whom we
have in four years rendered dependent
on supplies from those countries for
their daily food, or if wheat rises to
150s the quarter, and the quartern loaf
to 2s. in consequence of our refusal&mdash;if
the Thames, the Mersey, and the
Clyde are blockaded by hostile fleets,
and 700,000 or 800,000 manufacturers
with their families, for the sake of
the riches produced by whom we have
sacrificed everything, are suddenly
thrown out of employment&mdash;or if the
seamen of the Baltic and other maritime
powers of Europe have come to
outnumber our own in the carrying on
of our trade, and threaten to disable
our commerce, and bring us to death's
door, by simply recalling their crews&mdash;or
if the Bank stops payment in
the midst of these calamities, and
public and private credit are at once
destroyed at the very time when their
assistance is most needed&mdash;<i>then, and
not till then</i>, will England speak out
in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>How rapidly will the scales then
fall from the eyes which have so long
been blinded; how bitter will be the
regret at the inexplicable insensibility
now to solemn warnings; how
intense the indignation at the delusions
which, for the sake of present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
profit to the deluders, has so long
been practised upon them! The
burst of indignation with which the
appointment of the Lord Cardinal
was received throughout England,
the more suppressed apprehensions
with which the opening of the Californian
treasures was viewed by our
moneyed oligarchy, can afford but a
faint image of the feelings of agony
which will then wring the British
heart&mdash;the frightful cry of distress
which will then rise up from famishing
millions, the universal horror at
past neglect which will send the iron
into the soul of our whole people.
Their efforts to redeem the past will
probably be great, their struggles
will be those of a giant. But it
may be too late. They will be in
the condition of the Athenian people
when Lysander cast anchor off the
Pir&aelig;us, after the burning of their
fleet at Aigos Potamos; or of the Carthaginians,
when the legions of Scipio,
in the last Punic war, drew
round their walls; or of the Parisians,
when "Europe in arms before their
gates" demanded the surrender of all
their conquests. They will be profoundly
mortified&mdash;they will be cut to
the heart; they would give half they
possess for a deliverance, but they
will be <i>forced to submit</i>; and to the
annalist of these mournful times will
only remain the task of drawing the
appropriate moral from the melancholy
tale, and recording the fall and
ruin of England for the instruction of,
and as a beacon to be avoided by,
future times.</p>

<p>The Free Trade and Bullionist
orators will exclaim that this statement
is overcharged&mdash;that these apprehensions
are entirely chimerical&mdash;that
neither France nor Russia have
the slightest intention of going to
war with us&mdash;that the days of hostility
between nations are at an end&mdash;that,
even if we were attacked, our
resources are greater than ever&mdash;and
that the insular situation of Great
Britain gives her a security which
renders the maintenance of costly
armaments for the national defence
wholly unnecessary. This is what
they <i>will say</i>; and we tell them what
<i>they will not say</i>.&mdash;They will never
allude to the arguments which follow,
which will demonstrate the reality of
all this peril as clearly as any proposition
in Euclid; if they do allude to
them, it will only be to ridicule and
misrepresent&mdash;the usual resource of
detected error in presence of irresistible
arguments. They will never
allude to the facts or arguments adduced
on the other side; but, treating
the whole persons who adduce them&mdash;and
ourselves among the rest&mdash;as
utter fanatics and monomaniacs,
continue to inculcate on their numerous
readers&mdash;who never look at any
papers on the other side&mdash;the entire
security of the nation, the evident
advent of a time when all wars are
to cease, our secure and unassailable
position, and the utter folly of incurring
the certain evil of present expense
for the purpose of warding off
such contingent, remote, and chimerical
dangers. We are well aware of
the ability with which this method
of upholding delusions is carried on,
and of the readiness with which it
is listened to both by the opulent and
powerful class whose means of
amassing fortunes would be diminished,
and the numerous class whose
burdens would in a slight degree be
increased by a change of system.</p>

<p>The argument, that the era of
wars has ceased, that Peace Congresses
are henceforth to supersede
the logic of cannon, and that the
sooner we disband our troops, and
sell our ships of the line, as a costly
relic of a preadamite age, the better&mdash;would
be an extremely strong one,
and deserving of the most serious
consideration, if it had any foundation
in fact. But if this is not
the case&mdash;if, on the contrary, the
facts are all of an opposite character&mdash;then
the argument, based
on such a fallacious foundation, becomes
the strongest which can be
urged on the other side. Now, without
going back to former times and
the annals of history, let us attend
only to our own days, and what we
see around us, to ascertain whether
there is any likelihood of war becoming
unknown among men, and a
real millennium causing all swords to
be turned into pruning-hooks.</p>

<p>Everybody knows that the tendency
of the present times is to become
democratic; and it is chiefly in the
increased weight of the people&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
greatest sufferers from the ravages of
war&mdash;in the direction of public affairs,
that the advocates of universal peace
rest their predictions of the immediate
advent of a pacific millennium.
What countenance do the facts of
recent times&mdash;even if all previous
history were set aside&mdash;afford to the
assertion that democratic influence is
essentially of a pacific character, and
that with the increase in all civilised
states of popular power, the disuse
and, at length, extinction of war
may be anticipated?</p>

<p>So far from affording any countenance
to such an idea, all recent, as
well as former experience, leads to
conclusions directly the reverse, and
induces the melancholy prognostication
that, with the general increase of
democratic influence, not only will
the sphere of future hostility be augmented,
but its fierceness and devastations
will be fearfully enhanced. Who
commenced the dreadful wars of the
French Revolution, which for twenty
long years deluged Europe with
blood, and brought the tricolor standards&mdash;the
emblem of Republicanism&mdash;into
every capital of continental
Europe?&mdash;Democratic ascendency in
Paris; the crimes and ambition of
the Girondists; the bloodthirsty passions
of the Jacobins, which, not content
with ravaging and drenching
with gore their own country, could
not find vent but in the sacking and
plundering of all Europe. What
afterwards gave rise to the terrible
struggle in Poland in 1831, and induced
the multiplied sufferings of that
gallant but inconsiderate and infatuated
democracy?&mdash;The French Revolution
of 1830, which, but for the
firmness of Louis Philippe, and his
determination to risk all rather than
gratify the passion for war in the
Republicans who had elevated him
to power, would have involved
Europe in universal conflagration.
What brought on the horrid civil
war in Spain, which for five years
overwhelmed the Peninsula with
horrors and cold-blooded atrocities,
which throw even those consequent
on the invasion of Napoleon into
the shade?&mdash;A democratic triumph
in Madrid; the placing of a revolutionary
queen on the throne of
Spain; the determination and armed
intervention of England and France
to uphold the cause of popular aggression
in both kingdoms of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>What overturned the throne and
pacific policy of Louis Philippe?&mdash;His
determination to keep at peace; his
resolution to coerce, at any hazard,
the ambitious designs of the Parisian
democrats. He tried to be a "Napoleon
of Peace," and he lost his
throne and died in exile in consequence.
What immediately followed
the triumph of the Republicans
in Paris in February 1848? Was
it the reign of universal tranquillity&mdash;the
advent of peace and good-will
among men? Was it not, on the contrary,
an outbreak of general hostility&mdash;the
universal arming of nation
against nation, of people against
people, of race against race? Did not
Republican Piedmont invade Lombardy;
and Republican Prussia, Holstein;
and Republican France besiege
Rome? Did not the Magyar rise up,
against the Sclave, and the Bohemian
against the Austrian, and the Lombard
against both; and was not the
frightful scene of almost universal
hostility appeased&mdash;and that for the
time only&mdash;by the appalling appearance
of a hundred thousand Muscovites
on the Hungarian plains? Have
not Austria and Prussia for the last
six months been on the verge of a
dreadful contest? Have not the
burghers and ploughmen of all Germany
been called from their peaceful
avocations, to man the ranks of the
landwehr? Have not eight hundred
thousand men been arrayed on the
opposite sides, and the banks of the
Saale crowded with armies paralleled
only by those which in 1813 stood on
those of the Elbe? And what stopped
this dreadful war, and sent back
those multitudes of armed citizens
unscathed to their peaceful homes?
Was it republican France, or popular
England? No; it was despotic Russia.
It was the presence of a hundred
and fifty thousand armed and
disciplined Muscovites on the banks
of the Vistula, which like a thundercloud
overcast the east of Europe,
and at last cooled down the ardent
ambition of democratic Prussia into
something like a just estimate of the
chances of the conflict, and a tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>porary
respect for the rights of other
nations.</p>

<p>Turn to distant parts of the world,
and is the prospect more indicative of
the advent of a pacific millennium?
Is it to be found among the English
colonists in India, or the energetic
republicans of America? Have not
the English, for the last twenty years,
been engaged in almost ceaseless hostilities
in Hindostan or China, during
which ultimately our victorious standards
have been advanced to Cabul
and Nankin; and we have seen our
empire shaken to its very foundation
by the disasters of the Coord Cabul
Pass, and the frightful contest on the
banks of the Sutlej? Is America
more peaceful, and is the advent of
the reign of peace foreshadowed by the
entire abstinence from ambitious and
angry passions in the republicans of
its southern or northern hemisphere?
Has not the former, since the disastrous
era when its revolution began, been
the theatre of convulsions so frequent,
and bloodshed so incessant, that history,
in despair, has ceased to record
the names of these conflicts, and
points with horror only to their woeful
consequences? And has not Northern
America, during the last twenty
years, exhibited the most unequivocal
evidence of the lust of conquest having
gained possession of the most
influential portions of her inhabitants?
Were they not actually at war with
us in 1837 to support the Canadian
revolutionists; did they not cheat us
out of three-fourths of Maine, and
bully us out of half of Oregon; and
have they not squatted down, without
the vestige of a title, on Texas; and
when the Mexicans resented the aggression,
invaded their territory and
wrested from them the half of it,
including the whole auriferous region
of California? In short, war surrounds
us on all sides; its passions
are raging throughout the world; an
era of such hostile prognostications
is scarcely to be found in the annals
of mankind. And yet Mr Cobden
and Mr Bright declare, to admiring
and assenting audiences in Manchester,
that the era of war is past, and
that we should disband our troops and
sell our ships of the line! They are
like an insane patient in a distant
wing of a building which is wrapped
in flames, who positively refuses to do
anything to save himself, saying,
"They will never reach me."</p>

<p>Has the conduct of the English
Government for twenty years past
evinced the reality of the alleged disinclination
to hostilities which is said
to be creeping over all established
governments, and to which popular
ones in particular are in so remarkable
a manner averse? Has not our
conduct, on the contrary, even in
Europe, been aggressive and provocatory
to war in the very highest degree?
Did we not unite with France to force
a revolutionary government on Spain
and Portugal, and to prevent a legitimate
one in Belgium from recovering
its lawful possessions? Did we not,
along with Russia, Prussia, and Austria,
throw down the gauntlet, at the
time of the bombardment of Beyrout
and the siege of Acre, to France; and
did not the firmness of Louis Philippe
and the accession of Guizot, whom he
called to his councils at the critical
moment, alone prevent a general
and frightful war in Europe? It
is well known, to all persons acquainted
with the subject, that we were
still nearer a war with France some
years afterwards, when the affair of
Otaheite and Queen Pomare revived
the ancient and undying jealousy of
the two countries. We know it for a
fact, that at that period the French
were prepared for, and <i>fully expected</i>
instant hostilities; and that for
several nights six thousand choice
light troops slept armed and accoutred
on board the huge war-steamers at
Cherbourg, ready to start at daybreak
for a descent on the southern shores
of Britain, and on some of its undefended
dockyards, where not a vestige
of preparation had been made to repel
them.</p>

<p>But why recur to periods comparatively
remote for proofs of a state of
things which recur under our present
foreign administration as periodically
as commercial catastrophes do under
our monetary system? In November
1849 we sent Admiral Parker, with
the whole Mediterranean fleet, to the
mouth of the Dardanelles, and took
the Czar by the beard to rescue from
his grasp some thousand Hungarian
insurgents; and not content with this
demonstration&mdash;which was as hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
as the anchoring of a Russian fleet off
the Nore would have been to this
country&mdash;he was directed to cast
anchor, on his return, off the Pir&aelig;us,
and bid defiance to France and Russia,
the guarantees with ourselves of the
independence of Greece. On this
occasion we were so near a rupture
that the <i>French ambassador actually
left London</i>, and the Russian one was
preparing to follow his example, when
an immediate war with the two largest
powers of Europe&mdash;thus, by unparalleled
rashness on our part, brought, for
the first time for half a century, to act
cordially together&mdash;was only prevented
by our succumbing and referring the
matter to arbitration, as they had all
along proposed, instead of exacting it
at the cannon's mouth, as we had at
first endeavoured to do. And for
what mighty national interest was this
enormous peril incurred, when, as
usual, we were wholly unprepared to
meet it? Was it to save Hindostan
from invasion, or raise the blockade of
the Nore, or extricate our fleet from
the grasp of the Czar? No! It was
to enforce <i>private</i> claims of M. Pacifico
and Mr Finlay on the Greek Government,
to the amount of a few thousand
pounds&mdash;a proceeding which afforded
the Continental powers, if they had
been as hostilely disposed as our
Government, a fair precedent for sending
a Russian fleet of thirty ships of
the line to the Nore, to demand
satisfaction from our Government
for the brutal attack on Marshal
Haynau! And yet, such is the
infatuation produced by party spirit,
that not only was this aggressive act
approved by a majority of the
House of Commons, even after we
had been obliged to recede from it,
but it was approved by the very men
who are constantly preaching up
the immediate advent of a pacific millennium,
and the necessity of disbanding
our troops and selling our ships
of the line.</p>

<p>Surrounded then, as we undeniably
are, with the flames and the passions
of war on every side; slumbering on
the edge of a volcano, the fires of
which are smouldering under our
feet and gathering strength for a
fresh and still more terrific explosion;
actuated as we are by unbounded
national haughtiness, and a most
aggressive system of foreign policy,
have we done anything to support
our pretensions, or avert those
ravages from our own shores which
we have so liberally scattered on all
the adjacent coasts? Have we 100,000
regular troops and 200,000 landwehr,
in the British Islands, ready to
repel insult; and a fleet of 30 ships
of the line and 20 armed steamers,
ready afloat and <i>manned</i>, on the
German Ocean and in the Channel, to
secure our harbours from attack, and
raise a blockade of our coasts?
Have we&mdash;since we are so set upon a
foreign war, and have done so much
to spread the passions which necessarily
lead to it, and made so many
hostile demonstrations <i>calculated instantly
to induce it</i>&mdash;made preparations
in our Exchequer and our granaries
for its expenses and its privations?
Have we, like Frederick the Great
when he invaded Silesia, a fund of
&pound;7,000,000 in the Treasury, to meet
his war expenses; or Napoleon,
when he plunged into Russia, a reserve
of &pound;14,000,000 in the vaults of
the Tuileries? Have we fortified
Woolwich, the general arsenal of the
empire, and Chatham, and our other
naval depots, hitherto undefended?
Have we cleared out the glacis of
Portsmouth and Plymouth, so as to
give free range to the guns of the
works, and established a great central
fortification at Weedon, or some
other central point in England,
whither our troops might retire, if
obliged to evacuate London, and
where the new levies, raised in
haste, might receive the elements
of discipline, without the risk of
being assailed, while yet in the awkward
squad state, by the enemies'
cuirassiers?</p>

<p>Alas! we have done none of these
things. Woolwich is still an open
depot, liable to be taken by a single
regiment; there is not a bastion at
Weedon; there is not a defensible
post in the environs of London;
Chatham, Sheerness, and Deptford
are entirely open on the land side; and
although Portsmouth and Plymouth
are fortified, and may be pronounced
impregnable against a naval assault,
they are far from being so against a
land force. The enemy would not
require to run a sap up to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>counter-scarp:
we have saved him the
trouble, by allowing houses to be
built almost everywhere so near the
ditch, that the besiegers would effect
a lodgment there the first day, and
be able to batter in the breach in two
days more. Landwehr we have none,
unless 30,000 pensioners&mdash;most valuable
veterans, of great use against
mobs, or for garrison service, but little
qualified for the field&mdash;deserve the
name: our yeomanry, though admirably
mounted and full of spirit, are
wholly unacquainted with the duties,
and unaccustomed to the fatigues, of
actual warfare. We have not more
than seven or eight ships of the line,
and these but <i>imperfectly manned</i>,
ready for sea in our harbours; and
the regular troops in Great Britain,
though second to none in the world
in discipline and courage, can only
muster 37,000 sabres and bayonets,
and in the two islands amount only to
61,000!! In proportion to the eagerness
with which we have spread abroad
the passions and lighted the flames of
war in all the adjoining states, is
the assiduity with which we have
neglected or abandoned our own defences;
and the promptitude we have
evinced, on every possible occasion,
to provoke the hostility or rouse the
jealousy of the most powerful states
in our neighbourhood can be paralleled
only by the simultaneous reductions
we have effected in our own
armaments, and the utterly defenceless
state in which we have exposed
ourselves to their attacks. Judging
from our internal reductions, one
would suppose we were never again
to go to war: judging from our foreign
policy, one would suppose we were
never again to be at peace.</p>

<p>To illustrate these remarks, and
demonstrate the utter insanity of our
simultaneous adoption of the most
aggressive foreign policy and the
most pacific internal preparation, we
subjoin from Sir Francis Head's late
most admirable and interesting work
a <i>vidimus</i> of the military force of the
principal European powers, as compared
with that of Great Britain,
and subjoin to it a statement of our
naval force, accompanied with that of
France, Russia, and the United
States&mdash;the principal maritime powers
of the Continent and America:&mdash;</p>

<p>This is the <i>entire force</i>, so far as
European troops are concerned, which
is on foot to protect the immense
British dominions in the four quarters
of the globe! And as the entire
regular force in Great Britain and
Ireland is only 61,848 men, with 40
guns equipped for the field&mdash;and at
least a fifth of every military force
must always be deducted for sick,
absent, and deserters&mdash;it follows that
50,000 men, with 40 guns, is the
very utmost of regular troops that
could be relied on in both islands
to meet an enemy. Of this at least
20,000 would require to be left in
Ireland; so that 30,000 men alone
could be assembled in the last
extremity for the defence of Great
Britain! As to the pensioners
and yeomanry, they would be
entirely absorbed in forming garrisons,
keeping up the communications,
and preserving tranquillity
in the manufacturing towns in the
interior.</p>

<p>Formidable as this state of matters
is, it becomes doubly serious when
the state of our naval force is considered.</p>

<p>In 1792, before the war broke out,
and when our population was not a
half, nor our commerce and colonial
dominions a fourth of what they now
are, the naval force of Great Britain

<p>Thus Russia and France could produce
85 ships of the line, 80 frigates,
and 102 war-steamers, against our
65 or 70 of the line, 147 frigates,
and 56 war-steamers. A disproportion
sufficiently great for a country
which boasts of being mistress of the
waves: the more especially when it
is recollected that both these hostile
nations are actuated by the greatest
jealousy of our naval power, and envy
of our commercial greatness, and that
we have so managed our foreign policy
that, not six months ago, we were
within a hairsbreadth of a war with
<i>both united</i>. We are aware of the resources
which, if the contest were
prolonged for any considerable period,
would arise to this country from the
steam-packets to America and the
West Indies, which their owners are
taken bound, on an emergency, to
place at the disposal of the Admiralty.
But this provision, though a most wise
and judicious one, and of very great
moment in a lengthened conflict,
would obviously be of little or no
avail if war surprised us, as to all
appearance it will do, in our usual state
of fancied security and entire want of
preparation, and a Russian fleet of
twenty-five ships of the line from the
Baltic anchors off the Nore, simultaneously
with a French one of ten off
Portsmouth, with as little warning or
intimation as Admiral Parker gave to
the Russians when he appeared at
the mouth of the Dardanelles, or to
the Greek Government when he
cast anchor off the harbour of the
Pir&aelig;us.</p>

<p>But the danger becomes incomparably
greater, and assumes the
most portentous aspect, when two
other circumstances connected with
our naval situation are taken into
consideration, of vital importance in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>this question, but which the advocates
for reduction studiously keep out of
view in its discussion.</p>

<p>The first is, the <i>immense extent of
the colonial empire</i> we have to defend,
and the consequent unavoidable <i>dispersion</i>
of our naval force, such as it
is, over the whole globe. This appears
in the most decisive manner from
the table quoted below, taken from
the <i>United Service Gazette</i> for December
1850, showing the distribution of
our ships of the line in commission up
to 25th November last.</p>

<p>This shows that out of twenty-eight
line-of-battle ships and fifties
in commission at that period, only
thirteen were in the British harbours,
and even including the Experimental
Squadron, only fifteen. Of
these, at least a half are mere guardships&mdash;such
as the Victory at Portsmouth&mdash;of
little real use but to furnish
a mast for the Admiral on the station
to hoist his flag. Of the six or
seven that really are fit for sea,
not more than one half are fully
manned. Accordingly, it is universally
known among naval men, that there
are not more than three or four ships
of the line that could on a sudden
emergency be got ready for sea in the
British harbours: being not <i>half</i> the
force which the Danes had when they
were suddenly attacked by Nelson in
1801, and by Lord Cathcart in 1807.
On the first occasion, they had nine
ships of the line and floating batteries
moored off Copenhagen: on the last,
<i>eighteen</i> ships of the line were taken
by the victors, and brought to the
British shores.</p>

<p>We are often told of the immense
force which England now has in her
steam-vessels&mdash;more numerous, it
is said, and unquestionably better
manned and navigated than any in
Europe; and the "Excellent," at
Portsmouth, is referred to as able at
a moment's warning to furnish the
requisite amount of experienced gunners.
Fully admitting the high discipline
and training of the gunners on
board the Excellent, of whose merits
we are well aware, they cannot do
impossibilities. They amount only to
five hundred <i>men</i>; and what are they
to the forces requisite to defend the
British shores against a combined
French and Russian fleet, such as we
<i>all but brought upon us</i> last April,
when the French ambassador left
London? What could four or five
hundred trained gunners do when
scattered over fifteen or twenty sail of
the line, and as many steamers, the
crews of which were suddenly huddled
together&mdash;supposing them got
at all&mdash;from the merchant service,
where they had received no sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
training in naval warfare? What
could the peace steam-boats, not
pierced for a single gun, do against
the broadsides of the Russian line-of-battle
ships, or the huge war-steamers
which excited such astonishment
among our naval men, when exhibited
at the late review at Cherbourg?
The thing is quite ridiculous. They
would furnish, in Napoleon's words,
ample <i>chair au cannon</i>, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>Contrast this now with the state of
preparation in which the French and
Russian navies are kept, in consequence
of their having both a regular
force raised by conscription, and
constantly paid and under arms like
their land forces, wherewith to commence
the conflict. The Czar has
always <i>twenty ships</i> of the line and
ten frigates in the Baltic, completely
equipped and ready for sea, with
30,000 soldiers ready to step on board
of them; and it would be surprising
if, in passing the Sound, they were
not reinforced by the six ships of the
line and steam-frigates at the disposal
of Denmark,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who would desire nothing
better than to return, in a manner
equally unexpected, the sudden
visits we paid her in 1801 and 1807.
France, in addition to sixteen ships
of the line in commission, and double
that number of war-steamers, has
no less than 55,000 seamen ready to
be called on, like the national guard,
at a moment's warning, perfectly
trained to gunnery and warlike duties,
who could man double that number of
line-of-battle ships and war-steamers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The French nation, however, deeming
it unsafe to rest on any such frail contingency
as voluntary enlistment, has
wisely, as well as justly, decreed that her
maritime districts and commercial marine
shall be subject to the <i>same obligation</i> to
serve their country as the other classes
of the community; and, accordingly, by
the laws of France, every boy who goes
to sea is required to register his name on
the 'Inscription Marine.' After one
year's probation, he enters into the class
of 'Mousses' until he is sixteen, when he
becomes a 'novice' or apprentice till
eighteen, when he is classed as a marine
or seaman, and <i>he is thenceforward at the
service of the state till he is fifty years of
age</i>. Besides this, about 1/20 of the general
conscription throughout the inland
provinces are by law liable to serve in
the navy. By the above arrangements,
it appears that between the year 1835
and 1844, both inclusive, 55,517 seamen
answered the calls of the annual <i>Lev&eacute;e
permanente</i>, and, moreover, that very
nearly <i>the whole</i> of the French merchant
seamen, amounting altogether to upwards
of 100,000 men, must have passed successively
through the royal navy.</p>

<p>"Under this admirable system&mdash;which,
while it flatters the passions, cultivates
the mind, and comfortably provides for
the sailor,&mdash;the French nation are prepared,
by beat of drum, to march from
their various quarters to their respective
ships, <i>compagnies permanentes</i> of well-trained
gunner seamen; and thus, at a
moment's warning, even in time of peace,
to complete the manning of <i>sixteen sail of
the line</i>."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir Francis Head</span>, 184, 185.</p></div>

<p>It is no exaggeration, therefore,
but the simple truth, to say, that
France and Russia could, in ten days
from the time that their respective
ambassadors left London, appear with
a fleet of <i>thirty ships of the line and
forty frigates or war-steamers in the
Channel</i>, with which they could
with ease blockade the Thames,
Portsmouth, and Plymouth, where not
more, at the very utmost, than eight
or ten line-of-battle ships, and ten or
twelve war-steamers, most of them
only half manned, could be collected
to oppose them. We have no doubt
the crews of this diminutive fleet
would do their duty as nobly as they
did at the Nile and Trafalgar; but we
shudder at the thought of the national
blindness and infatuation which
would expose them, and with them
the existence of England as an independent
nation, to such fearful odds.</p>

<p>In any such conflict, it is by the
forces which can <i>suddenly be rendered
available</i> that everything will be determined.
It may be quite true that
England possesses resources in the
vast extent of her mercantile navy
and steam-vessels, and the undaunted
character of her seamen, which, in
any <i>prolonged</i> contest, would give her
the same superiority which she maintained
throughout the last war; but
it is not the less true, that this contingent
ultimate superiority would be
of no avail to avert disaster&mdash;it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>be conquest&mdash;if the enemy, by having
their forces better in hand, and available
<i>in the outset</i>, were in a situation
to gain an advantage which could
never be recovered from in the commencement.
It is impossible to overestimate
the shock to credit, and ruin
to the best interests of the empire,
which would arise from a blockade of
our harbours even for a single fortnight.
Of what would it avail us
that we had six noble sail of the line,
and double that number of war-steamers
in the Mediterranean, and
as many scattered through the world,
from China to California, if the
Thames, the Mersey, and the Clyde,
were blockaded by hostile fleets, and
Portsmouth and Plymouth could only
furnish five or six half-manned line-of-battle
ships to raise the blockade?
Russia has <i>no colonies</i>; France, next
to none: thus the whole naval
forces of both these Powers could
be brought to bear, without deduction
or defalcation of any sort, on Great
Britain, more than half of whose navy
is necessarily scattered over the globe.
Our distant fleets would, in such a
crisis, avail us as little as an army of
pawns, with bishops and knights,
would a chess-player who had received
checkmate.</p>

<p>In the next place, these considerations
become doubly powerful when it
is recollected how very peculiar and
tardy is the mode of <i>collecting men</i>,
which alone is now thought of in the
British navy. It is not generally
known by landsmen&mdash;though hereafter
they may come to know it to their
cost&mdash;that in England at present there
is <i>neither any standing royal naval
force, nor any compulsory means of
levying it</i>. By our great naval establishment
and right of impressing seamen,
we had, practically speaking,
both during the war: but these days
are past. The navy sailors are
changed as ships come into harbour,
and the right of impressment has
virtually become obsolete. When a
ship, after two or three years' service,
comes into port, she is immediately
<i>paid off</i>, and a new set of sailors,
wholly ignorant of war, are slowly
got together by the next captain who
gets that or a corresponding ship; who
in their turn, when they begin to become
expert at their new duties, are
displaced to make way for a third
body of untrained men! What should
we say to a manufacturer, a merchant,
or a general, who should conduct
things in this manner? Yet, such as
it is, it is the system of the British
navy. This subject, of vital importance,
has been so well illustrated
by two gallant naval officers, that we
cannot do better than quote their admirable
observations on it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A ship," says Admiral Bowles, "is
required to relieve another for foreign
service. She is selected, reported ready
for commission, the captain and officers
are appointed, and then volunteers are
advertised for. They come in slowly and
uncertainly. If the ship is a large one,
the men will not enter until the heaviest
part of the work of fitting is completed:
the equipment proceeds slowly and carelessly,
because energy and rapidity are
impracticable; but even then, those who
enter first feel they are unfairly worked,
and the seeds of discontent and desertion
are sown at the very commencement of
their service.</p>

<p>"Three, or sometimes four, months thus
pass away, before the ship's complement
is complete; and, in the meanwhile,
little progress is made in discipline or instruction.
She at last sails for her destination,
and relieves a ship which, having
been three or four years on active service
is, or ought to be, in a high state of efficiency;
but on its arrival in England it
is dismantled, the officers and crew are
paid off and discharged, and we thus proceed,
on the plan of perpetually creating
and as perpetually destroying, what we
have with so much labour and expense
endeavoured to obtain&mdash;an effective ship
of war."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p></div>

<p>Captain Plunkett adds his valuable
testimony to the same effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Voluntary enlistment may be considered
entirely inapplicable to cases of
emergency. There are no means of calculating
how long ships would be manning,
if, as would necessarily happen in
cases of emergency, their crews were not
increased by men recently paid off from
other ships. In peace, there are usually
<i>as many ships</i> paid off as commissioned in
a year; and thus the men who leave one
ship join another. But, even with this aid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>the average time occupied by general line-of-battle
ships in completing their crews,
we find to have been above five months.
In 1835-6, when we commissioned several
ships of line at once, they were <i>six months
waiting for seamen, and were then very ill
manned</i>. We may safely suppose that,
were ten sail of the line commissioned at
this moment, and did circumstances not
admit of paying others off, we should not
see them manned in less than <i>eight</i> months.
We may therefore say that, for any case
of emergency, simple volunteering will
fail, <i>as it always has failed</i>. We may
expedite the material fitting of a fleet;
we may move ships about our harbours,
put their masts in, and call them 'demonstration'
or 'advance ships!' we may
even fit them for sea&mdash;for the dockyard
men can do all that&mdash;but, when fitted,
<i>there they must remain</i> for months waiting
for seamen. Foreign powers are quite
aware of this, for it is the duty of their
consuls at our ports to inform their
governments, and they must laugh at
the demonstration by which John Bull
plays a trick upon&mdash;<span class="smcap">Himself!</span></p>

<p>"It is a matter of official avowal, and,
we may add, of personal and painful recollection,
that, in 1840, we were unable
to collect a few hundred seamen to make
a show of preparation.... When
England was vainly trying to scrape together
a few hundred seamen, France
had (in <i>compagnies permanentes</i>) upwards
of 3000 ready in the Atlantic ports, and
probably not less at Toulon.</p>

<p>"It is a fact as surprising as it is discreditable
to England, that <i>Russia could
send thirty sail of the line to sea before
England could send three</i>.</p>

<p>"It is scarcely an exaggeration to say,
we might <i>build</i> a ship in the time required
to <i>man</i> one."</p></div>

<p>We add not a word of comment on
these admirable passages. Further
illustration were worse than useless,
after such words coming from such
quarters.</p>

<p>It is often said that all fears of
invasion are ridiculous, after the
failure of Napoleon, who had 130,000
of the finest troops in the world to
effect it. The <i>Times</i>, with its usual
ability, makes the most of this argument.
We accept the challenge:
and, if we are not much mistaken,
that able journal will have no reason
to congratulate itself on having referred
to that period for support of its
argument:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The regular land forces of France
at that period were 450,000 men:
about the same as they are now.
But now that Power has, in addition,
2,000,000 well-trained National
Guards in arms, which, by rendering
her territory wellnigh unassailable,
leaves her whole regular force
available for foreign expedition.</p>

<p>2. England had then 160,000
regular troops on foot, including
30,000 of the army of reserve,
raised in the preceding years, of
whom about 100,000 were in the
British Islands. In 1808, the Duke
of York reported to Government
that, without detriment to any necessary
home service, 60,000 regulars
could be spared for the Peninsula;
and in 1809 she had 80,000 in active
warfare&mdash;viz., 40,000 at Walcheren,
30,000 in Spain, and 10,000 in Sicily.</p>

<p>3. In addition to this, she had
80,000 militia, quite equal to troops
of the line, in Great Britain and
Ireland, besides 300,000 volunteers
in arms, tolerably drilled and full of
spirit.</p>

<p>4. She had 83 ships of the line in
commission, and 230 in all the royal
dockyards, and 508 vessels of war
bore the royal flag.</p>

<p>5. She had a system of impressment
in active operation, which in
effect gave the Admiralty the command,
on an emergency, of the whole
sailors in the mercantile navy of
Great Britain, as they successively
came into harbour: and the magnitude
of the royal navy was such,
and its attractions&mdash;especially the
hopes of prize-money and glory&mdash;so
powerful, that the sailors of the fleet
were as much a <i>standing force</i> as
Napoleon's grenadiers.</p>

<p>6. Austria and Russia were then
in close alliance, offensive and defensive,
with Great Britain, and
80,000 Muscovites, under Kutusoff,
were hastening through Poland and
Moravia to join 90,000 Austrians,
who were on the Inn, threatening to
invade Bavaria.</p>

<p>7. So instant was the danger, and
so pressing the approach of a contest
with the two greatest military
powers on the Continent, that
Napoleon was obliged to count not
only by weeks but <i>by days</i>; and
he had only just time enough to
close the war, as he himself said, by
"a clap of thunder on the Thames,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
before he would be called on to
combat for his existence on the
Danube."</p>

<p>Such were the circumstances under
which Napoleon then undertook his
long meditated and deeply laid project
for the invasion and conquest
of Great Britain. His plan was to
decoy Lord Nelson away to the
West Indies by a feigned expedition
of the combined Toulon and Cadiz
fleets, and for them suddenly to
return, join the Ferrol squadron, pick
up those of Rochefort and l'Orient,
unite with that of Brest, and with
the united force, which would be
sixty sail of the line, proceed into
the Channel, where it was calculated
there would only be twenty or
twenty-five to oppose them; and,
with this overwhelming force, cover
the embarkation of the 130,000 men
whom he had collected on the coast
of the Channel. The plan was not
original on the part of Napoleon,
though he had the whole merit of
the organisation of the stupendous
armament which was to carry it
into execution. The design was
originally submitted, in 1782, by
M. de Bouill&eacute; to Louis XVI., and
Rodney's victory alone prevented it
from being attempted at that time.
France's designs in this respect are
fixed and unalterable: they were the
same under the mild and pacific
Louis as the implacable Napoleon,
and suggested as ably by the chivalrous
and loyal-hearted de Bouill&eacute;,
the author of the flight of the Royal
family to Varennes, as by the
regicide Talleyrand, or the republican
D&eacute;cr&egrave;s.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Such was Napoleon's plan, formed
on that of M. de Bouill&eacute;; and, vast
and complicated as it was, it all but
succeeded. Indeed, its failure was
owing to a combination of circumstances
so extraordinary that they
can never be expected to recur again;
and even these are to be ascribed
rather to the good providence of God,
than to anything done by man to counteract
it.</p>

<p>Nelson's fleet of ten line-of-battle
ships pursued the combined fleet of
twenty from Cadiz to the West Indies;
but they had four weeks the
start of him: and upon arriving there
in the beginning of June, he received
intelligence that they had set
sail ten days before for Europe. Instantly
divining their plan, he&mdash;without
losing an hour&mdash;despatched several
fast-sailing brigs to warn the Admiralty
of their approach. One of
these, the <i>Curieux</i>, which bore the
fortunes of England on its sails, outstripped
all its competitors, and even
outsailed the combined fleet, so as to
arrive at Portsmouth on the 9th July.
Without losing an hour, the Admiralty
sent orders by telegraph to Admiral
Calder to join the Rochefort
blockading squadron, and stand out
to sea, in order to intercept the
enemy on his return to the European
seas. He did so; and with fifteen
sail of the line met the combined
fleet of twenty, on the 15th July:
engaged them, took two ships of the
line, and drove the fleet back into
Ferrol; where, however, he was too
weak to blockade them, as their junction
with the squadron there raised
their force to thirty ships of the
line.</p>

<p>Though this was a severe check,
it did not altogether disconcert Napoleon.
He sent orders to Villeneuve
to set sail from Ferrol, and join the
Rochefort and Brest squadrons which
were ready to receive him, and which
would have raised the combined
fleet to fifty-five line-of-battle ships,
then to make straight for the Channel,
where Napoleon, with one hundred
and thirty thousand men, and
fifteen hundred gun-boats and lesser
craft, lay ready to embark. On the
21st August, the Brest squadron, consisting
of twenty-one sail of the line,
under Gantheaume, stood out to sea.
Every eye was strained looking to
the south, where Villeneuve with
thirty-five line-of-battle ships, was
expected to appear. What prevented
the junction, and defeated this admirably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>laid plan, which had thus
obtained complete success so far as it
had gone&mdash;for Nelson was still a long
way off, his fleet having been wholly
worn-out by their long voyage, and
obliged to go into Gibraltar to refit?
It was this: Villeneuve set sail from
Ferrol with 29 sail of the line, on the
11th August, but instead of proceeding
to the north&mdash;in conformity with his
orders&mdash;to join Gantheaume off Brest,
<span class="smcap">he steered for Cadiz</span>, which he
reached in safety on the 21st of August,
the very day on which he had
been expected at Brest, without meeting
with Sir Robert Calder, who had
fallen back into the Bay of Biscay.
For this disobedience of orders, Napoleon
afterwards brought Villeneuve to
a court-martial, by which he was condemned.</p>

<p>This unaccountable disobedience of
orders entirely defeated Napoleon's
scheme, for Austria was now on, the
verge of invading Bavaria. He accordingly
at once changed his plan;
and, as he could no longer hope for a
naval superiority in the Channel, before
the Austrian invasion took place,
directed all his forces to repel the
combined Austrian and Russian forces
in Bavaria and Italy. On September
1, his whole army received
orders to march from the heights of
Boulogne to the banks of the Danube.
On the 20th October, Mack defiled,
with thirty thousand men as prisoners
before him, on the heights of Ulm;
and on the day after&mdash;October 21&mdash;Nelson
defeated Villeneuve at Trafalgar,
took nineteen ships of the line,
and ruined seven more. Between
that battle and the subsequent one
of Sir R. Strachan, thirty ships of
the line were taken or destroyed;
all hope of invasion for the remainder
of the war was at an end; and
"ships, colonies, and commerce"
had irrevocably passed to Napoleon's
enemies.</p>

<p>Such was the extraordinary and
apparently providential combination
of circumstances which defeated this
great plan of Napoleon for the invasion
of this country&mdash;a plan which, he
repeatedly said, was the best combined
and most deeply laid of any he
had ever formed in his life. Its failure
was owing to accident, or some
overruling cause which cannot be
again relied on. Had the <i>Curieux</i>
not made the shortest passage ever
then known, from Antigua&mdash;twenty-four
days; had Villeneuve reached
the Channel unexpectedly on the 20th
or 21st July, as he would have done
but for its arrival&mdash;had he even sailed
for Brest on the 11th August, as
ordered, <i>instead of to Cadiz</i>, the invasion
would in all human probability
have taken place. What its result
would have been is a very different
question. With a hundred and
eighty thousand regular troops and
militia in arms in the British Islands,
besides three hundred thousand volunteers,
the conflict must at least have
been a very desperate one. But
what would it be now, when the
French and Russians have greater
land forces to invade us; when their
naval superiority, at least in the outset
of the contest, would be much
more decisive; and, with a much
more divided and discontented population
at home, we could only&mdash;at the
very utmost&mdash;oppose them with fifty
thousand effective men in both islands,
in the field.</p>

<p>It is often said by persons who
know nothing of war, either by study
or experience, that "if the French
invaded us, we would all rise up and
crush them." Setting aside what
need not be said to any man who
knows anything of the subject&mdash;the
utter inadequacy of an unarmed, untrained,
and undisciplined body of
men, however individually brave, to
repel the attack of a powerful regular
army&mdash;we shall by one word settle
this matter of the nation rising up.
It would rise up, and we know what
it would do. The <i>most influential
part of it, at least in the towns, who
now rule the state, would run away</i>.
We do not mean run away from the
field; for, truly, very few of those who
now raise the cry for economy and
disarming would be found there. We
mean they would counsel, and, in
fact, insist on submission. Many
brave men would doubtless be found
in the towns, and multitudes in the
country, who would be eager at the
posts of danger; but the great bulk
of the wealthy and influential classes,
at least in the great cities, would
loudly call out for an accommodation
on any terms. They would surrender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the fleets, dismantle Portsmouth and
Plymouth, cede Gibraltar and Malta&mdash;<i>anything
to stop the crisis</i>. They
would do so for the same reason that
they now so earnestly counsel disbanding
the troops and selling the
ships of the line, and under the influence
of a much more cogent necessity&mdash;in
order to be able to continue
without interruption the making of
money. Peace, peace! would be the
universal cry, at least among the
rich in the towns, as it was in Paris
in 1814. There would be no thought
of imitating the burning of Moscow,
or renewing the sacrifice of Numantia.
The feeling among the vast majority
of the manufacturing and mercantile
classes would be&mdash;"What is
the use of fighting and prolonging
so terrible a crisis? Our workmen
are starving, our harbours are
blockaded, our trade is gone, we are
evidently overmatched; let us on
any terms get out of the contest, and
sit quietly on our cotton bags, to
make money by weaving cloth for
our conquerors."</p>

<p>We have said enough, we think, to
make every thoughtful and impartial
mind contemplate with the most
serious disquietude the prospect which
is before us, under our present system
of cheapening everything, and, as a
necessary consequence, reducing the
national armaments to a pitiable degree
of weakness in the midst of
general hostility, and the greatest
possible increase of available forces on
the part of all our neighbours, rivals,
and enemies. But let us suppose
that we are <i>entirely wrong</i> in all we
have hitherto advanced&mdash;that there
is not the slightest danger of an invasion
or blockade from foreign
powers, or that our home forces are
so considerable as to render any such
attempt on their part utterly hopeless.
There are three other circumstances,
the direct effects of our present Free
Trade policy, any one of which is
fully adequate in no distant period
to destroy our independence, and
from the combined operation of
which nothing but national subjugation
and ultimate ruin can be anticipated.</p>

<p>The first is the extraordinary
and appalling increase which, since
Free Trade was introduced, has
taken place in the proportion of
the daily food of our population
which is furnished by <i>foreign states</i>.
Before the great change in our
policy began, the nation had been
rendered, practically speaking, self-supporting.
The importation of
wheat, for the five years from 1830
to 1835, was only 398,000 quarters;
and even during the five bad
years in succession, from 1836 to
1841, the average importation was
only 1,700,000 quarters. From
1830 to 1840, the average importation
of wheat and flour was only
907,000 quarters.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But since the
great change of 1846, the state
of matters has been so completely
changed that it is now notorious
that, in ordinary years, the importations
cannot be expected to be ever
less than 9,000,000 or 10,000,000
quarters of grain, about 5,000,000
quarters of which consists of wheat.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The importation in the single month
of July last, in the face of prices
about 42s. the quarter, was no less
than 1,700,000 quarters of all sorts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>of grain;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and in the month ending

<p>&mdash;Price, 39s. 9d. quarter of wheat.</p>

<p>The average of prices for the last
twelve weeks has been 39s. 9d. the
quarter; but the importation goes on
without the least diminution, and accordingly
the <i>Mark Lane Express</i> of
December 28, 1850, observes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the commencement of the year
now about to terminate, an opinion was
very prevalent that prices of grain (more
especially those of wheat) had been somewhat
unduly depressed; and it was then
thought that, even with Free Trade, the
value of the article would not for any
lengthened period be kept down below
the cost of production in this country.
The experience of the last twelve months
has, however, proved that this idea was
erroneous; for, with a crop very much
inferior to that of 1849, quotations have,
on the whole, ruled lower, the average
price for the kingdom for the year 1850
being only about 40s., whilst that for the
preceding twelve months was 44s. 4d.
per quarter. This fact is, we think, sufficient
<i>to convince all parties that, so long
as the laws of import remain as they now
stand, a higher range of prices than that
we have had since our ports have been thrown
open cannot be safely reckoned on</i>. The
experiment has now had two years' trial;
the first was one in which a considerable
failure of the potato crop took place in
England and Ireland; and this season we
have had a deficient harvest of almost all
descriptions of grain over the whole of
Great Britain. If, under these circumstances,
foreign growers have found no
difficulty in furnishing supplies so extensive
as to keep down prices here at a
point at which farmers have been unable
to obtain a fair return for their industry
and interest for the capital employed, we
can hardly calculate on more remunerating
rates during fair average seasons.
Under certain combinations of circumstances
prices may, perhaps, at times be
somewhat higher; but viewing the matter
on the broad principle, we feel satisfied
that, with Free Trade, the producers of
wheat will rarely receive equal to 5s. per
bushel for their crop."</p></div>

<p>Accordingly, so notorious has this
fact become, and so familiar have the
public become with it, that it has become
a common-place remark, which
is making the round of all the newspapers
without exciting any attention,
that the food of 7,000,000 of our
people has come to depend on supplies
from foreign countries. In fact
a much larger proportion than this, of
the wheaten food of the country, comes
from abroad; for the total wheat
consumed in Great Britain and Ireland
is under 15,000,000 quarters,
and the importation of wheat is from
4,000,000 to 5,000,000 quarters,
which is about a third. And of the
corresponding <i>decrease</i> in our own
production of grain, a decisive proof
has been afforded by the decline since
1846 in wheat grown in Ireland, the
only part of the empire where such
returns are made, which has stood
thus:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>Now, assuming&mdash;as experience
warrants us in doing&mdash;this state of
matters to be permanent, and the
growth of wheat in the British Islands
to be progressively superseded by importations
from abroad, how is the
<i>national independence</i> to be maintained,
when a <i>fourth of our people</i> have come
to depend on foreign supplies for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>daily food? Nearly all this grain, be
it recollected, comes from two countries
only&mdash;Russia, or Poland which it
governs, and America. If these two
powers are desirous of beating down
the naval superiority, or ruining the
commerce and manufactures of Great
Britain, they need not fit out a ship
of the line, or embark a battalion to
effect their purpose; they have only
to pass a <i>Non-Intercourse Act</i>, as
they both did in 1811, and wheat
will at once rise to 120s. the quarter
in this country; and in three months
we must haul down our colours, and
submit to any terms they may choose
to dictate.</p>

<p>In another respect our state of dependence
is still greater, for we rest
almost entirely on the supplies obtained
from a <i>single</i> state. No one
need be told that five-sixths, often
nine-tenths, of the supply of cotton
consumed in our manufactures come
from America, and that seven or
eight hundred thousand persons are
directly or indirectly employed in the
operations which take place upon it.
Suppose America wishes to bully us,
to make us abandon Canada or
Jamaica for example, she has no need
to go to war. She has only to stop
the export of cotton for six months,
and the whole of our manufacturing
counties are starving or in rebellion;
while a <i>temporary</i> cessation of profit
is the only inconvenience they experience
on the other side of the
Atlantic. Can we call ourselves independent
in such circumstances?
We might have been independent:
Jamaica, Demerara, and India, <i>might</i>
have furnished cotton enough for all
our wants. Why, then, do they not do
so? The mania of cheapening everything
has done it all. We have ruined
the West Indies by emancipating the
negroes, and then admitting foreign
sugar all but on the same terms as
our own, and therefore cotton cannot
be raised to a profit in those rich
islands&mdash;for <i>continuous</i> labour, of which
the emancipated negroes are incapable,
is indispensable to its production. In
the East Indies, the cultivation of
cotton has not been able to make any
material progress, because the mania
of Free Trade lets in American cotton,
grown at half the expense, without
protection. We have sold our independence,
not like Esau, for a mess of
pottage, but for a bale of cotton.</p>

<p>In the next place, the progressive
and rapid decrease in our shipping,
and increase of the foreign employed
in carrying on our trade, since the
Navigation Laws were repealed, is so
great that from that quarter also the
utmost danger to our independence
may be anticipated. We need not
remind our readers how often and
earnestly we have predicted that
this effect must take place; and
we shall now proceed to show how
completely, to the very letter,
these prognostics have been verified:&mdash;</p>

<p>The shipping returns of the Board
of Trade, for the month ending the
5th of November, present the following
results:&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Dec. 7, 1850.</p>

<p>The general results for the ten
months, from January 1, 1850, when
the repeal of the Navigation Laws
took effect, to October 31, are as follows,
and have been thus admirably
stated by Mr Young:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In the year 1840, the total amount of
tonnage entered inwards, in the foreign
trade of the United Kingdom, was
4,105,207 tons, of which 2,307,367 were
British, and 1,297,840 foreign. In 1845,
the British tonnage had advanced to
3,669,853, and the foreign to 1,353,735,
making an aggregate of 5,023,588 tons.
In 1849, the British entries were 4,390,375,
the foreign 1,680,894&mdash;together 6,071,269
tons. Thus, in ten years, with a growing
commerce, but under protection, British
tonnage had progressively increased
1,583,008 tons, or 56-1/3 per cent.; and
foreign 383,054 tons, or 29&frac12; per cent. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
this point, protection was withdrawn.
Free navigation has now been ten months
in operation, and the following is the
result:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The aggregate inward entries during
the ten months ended the 5th of November
1849, were 5,081,592 tons, of which
3,651,589 were British, and 1,430,003
foreign. During the corresponding ten
months ending the 5th of November of
the present year, the aggregate entries
are 5,114,064 tons, the British being
3,365,033, and the foreign 1,749,031.
Thus, comparing the first ten months after
the repeal of the Navigation Laws with
the corresponding ten months of the preceding
year, when those laws were in
operation, we find that British tonnage
<i>has decreased within this brief period no
less than 286,556, or 8-1/10 per cent, while
foreign tonnage has increased to the enormous
extent of 319,028 tons</i>, or 22-3/10
per cent, the whole entries having advanced
only 32,472 tons&mdash;thus showing
that our maritime commerce has not been
augmented in any appreciable degree by
the alteration, but that it has simply
changed hands. The foreigner has taken
what we have madly surrendered. I
may add, that never was the state, and
never were the prospects, of shipowners
so gloomy. Freights in all parts of the
world are unprecedentedly low, and, for the
first time within my recollection, ships
are actually returning from the British
West Indies in ballast.</p>

<p>"Could I regard the whole subject
with less of humiliating apprehension for
my country, I might derive satisfaction
from the confirmation of many predictions
on which I have formerly ventured,
afforded by an analysis of the return
from which the melancholy result I have
exhibited is taken. Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, Prussia, and Germany&mdash;countries
whose rivalry you have repeatedly
derided as undeserving of attention&mdash;have
increased in the ten months from 502,454
tons to 796,200 tons, or 58-4/10 per cent.
But I forbear. While all Europe bristles
with bayonets, the loom and the spindle
seem to be regarded as the chosen defences
of this now the most unwarlike nation
on the face of the earth. Wellington,
and Ellesmere, and Napier have in vain
essayed to arouse England to solicitude
for her national defences; and till some
imminently impending alarm shall
awaken my countrymen to a sense of the
insecurity in which they are unconsciously
reposing, I almost dread they will accept
the unworthy advice recently tendered
to them by the unadorned oracle
of Free Trade, to run every risk rather
than incur any expense. It is thus that,
under the illusory expectation of the most
infinitesimally minute reduction in the
freight of imported commodities, the
hazard of leaving our navy unmanned is
overlooked or disregarded."</p></div>

<p>In the single harbour of Liverpool,
the decrease of British shipping, in
the year 1850, has been <i>no less than</i>
100,000 <i>tons</i>; while the foreign has
swelled from 56,400 to 126,700.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
If such has been the result in less
than one year, what may be anticipated
if the system continues three
or four years longer? It is quite
evident that the foreign tonnage
employed in conducting our trade
will come to exceed the British, and
then, of course, our independence and
maritime superiority are alike at an
end.</p>

<p>The Free-Traders, in answer to
this appalling statement, say that the
entries outward exhibit a different
and less unfavourable result. Without
referring to the authority of Mr
Huskisson, who stated what is well-known
to all men practically engaged
with the subject, that the outward
entries afford no correct data for
judging of trade returns, it may be
sufficient to remark that the difference
is mainly owing, in the present
instance, to the prodigious multitude
of our <i>emigrants</i> to America, the
shipping employed in conveying whom
is estimated at 240,000 tons. The
Free-Traders first, by their final measures,
drive some 300,000 of our industrious
inhabitants out of the country
annually, in quest of the employment
which they have lost at home, and
then they rest on the tonnage required
to convey them away, in order to
conceal the effect of Free Trade in
shipping on our mercantile marine!
They are welcome to the whole benefit
which they can derive from
the double effect of Free Trade, first
on our people, and then on our
shipping.</p>

<p>These considerations become the
more forcible when it is considered, in
the third place, what immediate and
imminent risk there is that either our
principal colonies will ere long declare
themselves independent, or that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>they will be abandoned without a
struggle by our Free-Trade rulers.
Now, the tonnage between Great
Britain and Canada is about 1,200,000
tons, and to the West Indies somewhat
above 170,000. Fourteen hundred
thousand British tons are taken
up with our trade to these <i>two colonies
alone</i>; and if they become independent
states, that tonnage will, to the
extent of more than a half, slip from
our grasp&mdash;as they have the materials
of shipbuilding at their door, which
we have not. Eight or nine hundred
thousand tons will by that change at
once be severed from the British
Empire and added to the foreign tonnage
employed in carrying on our trade,
which is now about 2,200,000 tons.
That will raise it to above 3,000,000
tons, or fully a half of our whole
tonnage, foreign and British&mdash;which
is, in round numbers, about 6,000,000
tons. The intention of Government
to abandon our colonies to themselves
has been now openly announced.
Earl Grey's declaration of his resolution
to withdraw all our troops, except
a mere handful, from Australia, is
obviously the first step in the general
abandonment of the colonies to their
own resources, and, of course, their
speedy disjunction from the British
Empire. As the separation of Canada
and the West Indies is an event which
may ere long be looked for&mdash;not less
from the universal discontents of the
colonies, who have lost by Free Trade
their only interest in upholding the
connection with the British Empire,
than from the growing disinclination
of our Free Trade rulers to continue
much longer the burdens and expense
consequent on their government&mdash;it is
evident that, the moment it happens,
the foreign ships employed in carrying
on our trade will outnumber the
British. From that moment the
nursery for our seamen, and with it
the means of maintaining our maritime
superiority and national independence,
are at an end. And as this
separation will, to all human appearance,
take place the moment that we
are involved in a European war&mdash;which,
with the aggressive policy of
our Foreign Minister, may any day be
looked for&mdash;this is perhaps the most
immediate and threatening danger
which menaces the British Empire.</p>

<p>When the magnitude and variety
of the perils which Free Trade and
the cheapening system have brought
upon the British empire are taken
into consideration, it may appear
extraordinary that the foreign powers,
<i>who are perfectly aware of it all</i>, do
not at once step forward and secure
for themselves the rich prize which
we so invitingly tender to their grasp.
But the reason is not difficult to be
discerned. They know what England
once was, and they see whither, under
the new system, she is tending.
They anticipate our subjugation, or
at least our abrogation of the rank
and pretensions of an independent
power, at no distant period, from our
own acts, without their interfering in
the matter at all. They are fearful,
if they move too soon, of committing
the same fault which the Pope has
recently done, on the suggestion of
Cardinal Wiseman. They are afraid
of opening the eyes of the nation, by
any overt act, to the dangers accumulating
around them, before it is so
thoroughly debilitated by the new
system that any resistance would be
hopeless, and therefore will never be
attempted. They hope, and with
reason, to see us ruined and cast
down by our own acts, without their
firing a shot. Their feeling is analogous
to Napoleon's on the morning
of the battle of Austerlitz, when the
Allies were making their fatal cross-march
in front of the heads of his
columns, and exposing their flank to
his attack. When urged by his generals
to give the signal for an immediate
advance, he replied&mdash;"Wait!
when the enemy is making a false
movement, which will prove fatal if
continued, it is not our part to interrupt
him in it."</p>

<p>What, then, is the advantage which
the Free-Traders have to set off
against these obvious and appalling
dangers, past, present, and to come,
with which their policy is attended?
It is this, and this only&mdash;that the
manufacturing towns are prosperous,
and that our exports are increasing.
They point with exultation to the
following statement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The aggregate value of our exports,

<p>Now, let it be supposed that this
increase, which will amount to less
than L.7,000,000 in our exports in
the whole year, is all to be set down
to the credit of Free Trade. Let us
suppose that Californian gold, which
has given so unparalleled a stimulus
to America, and the lowering the
discounts of the Bank of England to
2&frac12; per cent&mdash;which has done so much,
as it always does, to vivify industry
and raise prices at home&mdash;and the
pacification of Germany by Muscovite
influences or bayonets, which
have again, after the lapse of two
years, opened the Continental markets
to our produce, have had nothing at
all to do with this increase in our
exports,&mdash;what, after all, does it
amount to, and what, on striking
the balance of profit and loss of
Free Trade, has the nation lost or
gained by its adoption?</p>

<p>It has increased our exports by
L.7,000,000 at the very utmost; and
as the total produce of our manufactures
is about L.180,000,000, this is
an addition of <i>a twenty-fifth part</i>. It
has made four or five hundred thousand
persons employed in the export
manufactures prosperous for the
time, and increased, by five or six
hundred thousand pounds in the last
year, the incomes of some eighty or
a hundred mill-owners or millionnaires.</p>

<p><i>Per contra.</i> 1. It has lowered the
value of agricultural produce of every
kind fully twenty-five per cent, and
that in the face of a harvest very deficient
in the south of England. As
the value of that produce, prior to the
Free-Trade changes, was about
L.300,000,000 a-year, it has <i>cut
L.75,000,000 off the remuneration for
agricultural industry over the two
islands</i>.</p>

<p>2. It has cut as much off the funds
available to the purchase of articles
of our manufacture in the home
market; for if the land, which pays
above half the income tax, is impoverished,
how are the purchasers at
home to find funds to buy goods?</p>

<p>3. It has totally destroyed the
West Indies&mdash;colonies which, before
the new system began, raised produce
to the value of L.22,000,000, and
remitted at least L.5,000,000 annually,
in the shape of rent, profits, and
taxes, to this country.</p>

<p>4. It has induced such ruin in Ireland,
that the annual emigration,
which chiefly comes from that agricultural
country, last year (1849)
reached 300,000 souls, and this year,
it is understood, will be still greater.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
This is as great a chasm in our population
as the Moscow retreat, or the
Leipsic campaign, made in that of
France; but it excites no sort of
attention, or rather the pressure of
unemployed labour is felt to be so
excessive, that it is looked on rather
as a blessing. The <i>Times</i> observes,
on January 1, 1851:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We see the population of Ireland
flowing off to the United States in one
continuous and unfailing stream, at a
rate that in twenty years, if uninterrupted,
<i>will reduce them to a third of
their present numbers</i>. We see at the
same time an increasing emigration from
this island. England has so long been
accustomed to regard excess of population
as the only danger, that she will be
slow to weigh as seriously as perhaps
she ought <i>this rapid subtraction of her
sinew and bone, and consequent diminution
of physical strength</i>. It is impossible,
however, that so considerable a
change should be attended with unmixed
advantage, or that human forethought
should be able to compass all the results.
The census of next spring may invite
attention to a subject, the very magnitude
of which may soon command our
anxiety."</p></div>

<p>5. It has totally ruined the West
Highlands of Scotland, which depend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>on two staples&mdash;kelp and black cattle&mdash;the
first of which has been destroyed
by free trade in barilla, and the
second ruined by free trade in cattle,
for the benefit of our manufacturing
towns, and sent their cottars in starving
bands to Glasgow, already overwhelmed
by above L.100,000 a-year
of poor-rates.</p>

<p>6. It has so seriously affected the
internal resources of the country,
that, with a foreign trade prosperous
beyond what has been seen since 1845,
the revenue is only L.165,000 more
than it was in the preceding year,
which was one of great depression;
and the last quarter has produced
L.110,000 less than the corresponding
quarter of 1849.</p>

<p>7. It has so lowered the <i>incomes</i> of
people in the country, that although
the number of travellers by railways
has greatly increased, and the total
receipts of the lines have been swelled
by L.1,700,000 since last year, the

no adequate proportion to its railway

<p>&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>which is a <i>fall</i> of L.55 a mile in the
midst of our boasted prosperous export
trade.</p>

<p>Such are the <i>advantages</i>, in consideration
of which the nation has
embarked on a course of policy
which so evidently, and in so many
ways, threatens our independence. It
is class government which has done it
all&mdash;the determination to make the
sovereign worth two sovereigns, and
a day's labour to the poor man worth
one shilling to him instead of two,
which has induced dangers in every
quarter, which threaten the existence
of Great Britain. Why is it that we
are constrained&mdash;though Government
are perfectly aware of the danger,
and the Duke of Wellington has
repeatedly pointed it out&mdash;to have a
military and naval force evidently
incommensurate to the wants of our
vast empire, and unable to defend it
from the hostility which our foreign
policy does so much to provoke?
Simply because we have surrendered
the government of the country to a
moneyed oligarchy, who are resolved,
<i>coute qui coute</i>, to cheapen everything,
because it enhances the value of their
realised wealth, and because the
measures of that oligarchy have cut
down Queen Victoria's income from
&pound;100,000,000&mdash;as it might have been,
and <i>is now, in real weight upon the
country</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>&mdash;to &pound;50,000,000; just as
they have reduced the income of the
poor needlewomen from 9d. a-day
to 4-1/2d. Why is it that we are
constrained, openly and avowedly,
to abandon our colonies to their own
resources? Only because the cheapening
system and Free Trade have
so paralysed and weakened our resources,
that, like the Romans, if we
would protect at all the heart of the
empire, we must forthwith abandon
its extremities.</p>

<p>Why are we evidently and undeniably
losing the empire of the seas,
by the rapid and portentous increase
of the foreign and decline of the English
shipping, in carrying on our own
trade? Only because freights must,
it is thought, be cheapened as well as
everything else; and the independence
of the country is a trifling consideration
to a fall of a farthing in the
pound, in the transport of some
articles, for the benefit of the Manchester
trader. Why are the West
Indies utterly ruined, and the annual
importation of slaves into Cuba and
Brazil doubled,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and discontent so
universally spread through our colonies,
that beyond all doubt, in the first
reverse, they will break off from the
mother country, if not previously
thrown off by it? Merely to carry out
the dogma of Free Trade, and lower
sugar, watered by the blood of the
slaves, a penny or twopence a pound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>to the British consumer. Why have
we brought 7,000,000 of our people,
in three years, to depend for their
daily food on foreign supplies, and
put ourselves entirely at the mercy of
the <i>two states</i> from which nearly all
that food comes? Only to enrich the
Manchester manufacturers, and appease
the cry for cheap bread, by
enabling them to beat down the wages
of labour from 1s. 6d. to 1s. a-day.
Why are poor-rates&mdash;measured in the
true way, by quarters of grain&mdash;heavier
in this year of boasted prosperity
than they were in any former year
of admitted adversity? Because, in
every department of industry, we
have beat down native by letting in
a flood of foreign industry. Why are
300,000 industrious citizens annually
driven into exile, and Ireland threatened
with a depopulation the most
rapid and extraordinary which has
been witnessed in the world since the
declining days of the Roman empire?
Because we would lower wheat from
56s. to 39s. a quarter; and thereby
we have extinguished the profits of
cultivation in a portion of our empire
containing 8,000,000 of inhabitants,
but so exclusively agricultural that
its exports of manufactures are only
&pound;230,000 a-year. It is one principle&mdash;the
cheapening system&mdash;devised by
the moneyed and manufacturing
oligarchy, and calculated for their
exclusive benefit, which has done the
whole.</p>

<p>Is there, then, no remedy for these
various, accumulating, and most
threatening evils? Must we sit down
with our hands across, supinely witnessing
the progressive dangers and
certain ultimate destruction of the
empire, merely because the measures
inducing all these perils are supported
by the moneyed and manufacturing
oligarchy who have got the command
of the House of Commons? We are
far from thinking that this is the case;
but if we would avert, or even mitigate
our dangers, we must set ourselves
first to remedy the most pressing.
Of these, the most serious, beyond
all question, are to be found in
our unprotected state,&mdash;for they may
destroy us as a nation in a month,
after some fresh freak of Lord Palmerston's
has embroiled us with some
of the great European powers. In
regard to other matters, and the
general commercial policy, the danger,
though not the less real, is not so
immediate, and experience may perhaps
enlighten the country before it
is too late. But it is otherwise with
our external dangers: they are instant
and terrible. The means of resisting
them are perfectly simple&mdash;they
will be felt as a burden by none;
on the contrary, they are calculated,
at the same time that they provide
for our national defence, to mitigate
the greater part of the domestic evils
under which the people labour.</p>

<p>Government tell us that they have
a surplus of L.3,000,000 this year in
their hands. We hope it is so, and
that it will not prove, like other surpluses,
greater on paper than in
reality. But let it be assumed that it
is as large as is represented. <i>That
surplus, judiciously applied, would save
the country!</i> It would raise our armaments
to such a point as, with the
advantages of our insular situation,
and long-established warlike fame,
would prevent all thoughts of invasion
on the part of our enemies. It would
give us 100,000 regular troops, with
those we already have&mdash;100,000 militia,
occasionally called out&mdash;and 25
ships of the line, with those already in
commission, to defend the British
shores. It is true, the continuance of
the Income Tax cannot be relied on&mdash;nor
should the country submit to it any
longer; for a tax which is paid exclusively
by 147,000 persons out of
28,000,000, is so obviously unjust, that
its further retention is probably impossible.
Additional direct taxation
upon the affluent classes is obviously
out of the question, for the chasms
made in the incomes of those depending
on land, who pay three-fourths of
it, are such that it would prove totally
unproductive. What, then, is to be
done to uphold the public revenue at
its present amount, or even prevent its
sinking so as to increase instead of
diminishing our helpless and unprotected
state? An obvious expedient
remains. Imitate the conduct of
America and Prussia, France and
Russia, and all countries who have
any regard either to their national
independence, or the social welfare
of their inhabitants. Lay a
moderate duty upon all importa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>tions,
whether of rude or manufactured
articles. In America it is 30
per cent, and constitutes nearly their
sole source of revenue: in Prussia it
is practically 40 or 50 per cent. By
this means nearly <i>half the tax is
paid by foreigners</i>&mdash;for competition
forces them to sell the articles taxed
cheaper than their ordinary price, with
the addition of the tax. It is spread
over so vast a surface among consumers,
that its weight is not felt;
being mixed up with the price of the
article sold, its weight is not perceived.
We pay in this way half the taxes of
America, Germany, and all the countries
to whom we chiefly export our
manufactures. Let us return them the
compliment, and adopt a system which
will make them pay the half of ours.
The whole, or nearly the whole, of the
Income Tax, which now produces
L.5,400,000 a-year, would by this
change be spent in increased purchases
in the home market, and sensibly
relieve its sinking state. This
change would at once obviate our external
dangers&mdash;for it would enable
Government, without sensibly burdening
the country, to maintain the national
armaments on such a scale as
to bid defiance to foreign attack. We
shall see in our succeeding paper
whether it would not, at the same
time, be an effectual remedy, and the
only one that would be practicable, to
the most serious part of our domestic
evils.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> "We have now lying before us both the printed and manuscript copy of the
petition of a valued friend (the late Rev. W. Howells, of Long Acre) against the bill
for granting to Roman Catholics the privilege of paralysing the hands and obstructing
the labour of Protestant statesmen. At page 92, in the Memoirs of that
eminent man, published by his friend and executor, Mr Bowdler, our readers will
find that petition speaking with little less than prophetic voice of the confusion and
misery certain to follow a measure which every Protestant, in proportion to the
clearness of his views of Divine truth, must consider a downright infraction of his
allegiance to his God.
</p>
<p>
"We quote three of the clauses in the petition alluded to, and we ask whether the
fears therein expressed have not been fulfilled to the very letter:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"'That the concession of the elective franchise has not only multiplied the crimes
and aggravated the miseries of Ireland, but shaken likewise the very foundation of
the glorious British constitution, the majority of Irish votes being virtually at the
disposal of a demoralising, disloyal, turbulent, and traitorous priesthood.
</p>
<p>
"'That the concession of the representative franchise would be productive of
further and progressive evils, and enable Romanists either to prosecute a successful
crusade for supremacy, or involve the country in all the horrors of a civil war.
</p>
<p>
"'That the grant of the representative franchise would soon introduce into the
British Senate such an influx of members from each side the Channel, as would, by
voting together on all occasions of emergency, control your honourable house and the
other estates of the realm, <span class="smcap">DICTATE TO THE MINISTERS OF THE CROWN, AND FORCE
THEM INTO ANY MEASURES</span> they pleased.'"

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Lord Eldon's Predictions in 1829, on the third reading of the Roman
Catholic Relief Bill.</span></p></div>

<p>
"The following predictions of this venerable nobleman were at the time sneered
at as the senile and effete expressions of a bigoted octogenarian. What a lesson has
he left to those who now hold the rudder of the state in their hands!&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"'I know that, sooner or later, this bill will overturn the aristocracy and the
monarchy. What I have stated is my notion of the danger to the Establishment.
Have they not Roman Catholic archbishops for every Protestant archbishop&mdash;Roman
Catholic deans for every Protestant dean? Did not the Roman Catholic ecclesiastics
dispute against Henry VIII. in defence of the power of the Pope? and in
Mary's time were not the laws affecting the Roman Catholics repealed, not by the
authority of Parliament, but through the influence of the Pope's legate? And even
though you suppress these Roman Catholics who utter these seditious, treasonable,
abominable, and detestable speeches, others will arise who will utter speeches more
treasonable, more abominable, and more detestable. No sincere Roman Catholic
could or did look for less than a Roman Catholic king and a Roman Catholic parliament.
Their lordships might flatter themselves that the dangers he had anticipated were
visionary, and God forbid that he should say, that those who voted for the third
reading of the bill will not have done so conscientiously, believing that no danger
exists or can be apprehended from it. But in so voting, they had not that knowledge
of the danger in which they were placing the great, the paramount interests of
this Protestant state,&mdash;they had not that knowledge of its true interests and situation,
which they ought to have. Those with whom we are dealing are too wary to
apprise you by any indiscreet conduct of the danger to which you are exposed.
When those dangers shall have arrived, I shall have been consigned to the urn, the
sepulchre, and mortality; but that they will arrive, I have no more doubt than that
I yet continue to exist.'"&mdash;<i>Bell's Life in London</i>, Dec. 21, 1850.</p></div>

<h2>CURRAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></h2>


<p>A noble land lies in desolation.
Years pass over it, leaving its aspect
only more desolate; the barbarian
takes possession of the soil, or the
outcast makes it his place of refuge.
Its palaces are in ruins, its chieftains
are in the dust; its past triumphs
are regarded as the exaggerations of
romance, or the fond fantasies of
fable. At length a man of intelligence
and vigour comes, delves into
the heart of the soil, breaks up the
mound, throws aside the wrecks of
neglect and time, opens to us the
foundations of palaces, the treasure-chambers
of kings, the trophies of
warriors, and gives the world the memorials
of a great people in the grave.</p>

<p>All analogy <i>must</i> be imperfect in
detail; and we have no desire to insist
on the perfection of our analogy between
the Golden Head of the East,
and the little kingdom whose fallen
honours are recorded in the volume
before us. But, if Ireland is even
now neither the <i>nominis umbra</i> which
the Assyrian empire has been for so
many ages, nor the Irish legislature
the heir of the fierce and falcon-eyed
council which sleeps in the sepulchres
of Nineveh, there is something of a
curious relationship in the adventurous
industry which has so lately exhumed
the monuments of Eastern grandeur,
and the patriotic reminiscence which
has retrieved the true glories of the
sister country, the examples of her
genius, from an oblivion alike resulting
from the misfortunes of the Land
and the lapse of Time.</p>

<p>Nor are we altogether inclined to
admit the inferiority of the moral
catastrophe of the Island to the
physical fall of the Empire. If there
be an inferiority, we should place it
on the side of the Oriental throne.
To us, all that belongs to mind
assumes the higher rank; the soil
trodden by the philosopher and the
patriot, the birthplace of the poet and
the orator, bears a prouder aspect, is
entitled to a more reverent homage,
and creates richer recollections in the
coming periods of mankind, than all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>the pomp of unintellectual power.
There would be to us a stronger claim
in the fragments of an Athenian tomb,
or in the thicket-covered wall of a
temple in the &AElig;gean, than in all the
grandeurs of Babylon.</p>

<p>It is now fifty years since the parliament
of Ireland fell; and, in that
period, there has not been a more
disturbed, helpless, and hopeless
country than Ireland, on the face of
the earth. Nor has this calamity
been confined to the lower orders;
every order has been similarly convulsed.
The higher professions have
languished and lost their lustre; the
Church has been exposed to a struggle
for life; the nobility have given up
the useless resistance to difficulties
increasing round them from hour to
hour; the landed interest is supplicating
the Court of Encumbered
Estates to relieve it from its burthens;
the farmers are hurrying, in huge
streams of fugitives, from a land in
which they can no longer live; and
the tillers of the ground, the serfs of
the spade, are left to the dangerous
teaching of an angry priesthood, or to
the death of mingled famine and
pestilence. A cloud, which seems to
stoop lower day by day, and through
which no ray can pierce, at once
chills and darkens Ireland.</p>

<p>The author of this important and
interesting volume, in a brief preface,
states his object as being that of
giving personal sketches of the leading
Irish characters of his time, exactly
as they appeared on the scenes of
professional and public life&mdash;most of
them being his acquaintance, some
his intimates. He concludes by
gracefully expressing his "hope, that
the reader will rejoice in a more
intimate acquaintance with them;
and that, in endeavouring to <i>elevate the
land of his birth</i>, he may make some
return for the kindness bestowed on
him by that of his adoption."</p>

<p>Here two objects are announced;
and, whether the <i>first</i> was the elevation
of his country by the characters
of its eminent men; or, whether the
country was the background for the
figures of the national history-piece,
he has given us a work which brings
the patriots and orators of Ireland
with singular force before the
eye.</p>

<p>His introduction to Curran was
sufficiently characteristic. When at
the Temple, he had written a poem
on the honours of his country, in
which the great orator of her Bar was
named with due admiration. The
popularity of the verses excited the
attention of their object, and the
young barrister received an invitation
to dine with Curran, then Master
of the Rolls, at the Priory, his villa,
a few miles from Dublin. The appointed
hour was five, and it was a
matter of importance to be punctual;
for beyond that hour dinner was to
wait for no man. His first view of
his host is graphically described. He
found him in his avenue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There he was; as a thousand times
afterwards I saw him, in a dress which
you would imagine he had borrowed from
his tipstaff; his hands in his sides, his
face almost parallel with the horizon&mdash;his
under lip protruded, and the impatient
step and the eternal attitude, only
varied by the pause in which his eye
glanced from his guest to his watch, and
from his watch reproachfully to his
dining-room."</p></div>

<p>However, it appears that the
ominous hour had not struck, and
they dined.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I had often seen Curran, often heard
of him, often read him, but no man ever
<i>knew</i> anything about him who did not
see him at his own table, with the few
whom he selected.... It was
said of Swift, that his rule was, to allow
a minute's pause after he had concluded,
and then if no person took up the conversation
to recommence. Curran had no
conversational <i>rule</i> whatever: he spoke
from impulse, and he had the art so to
draw you into a conversation, that, though
you felt an inferiority, it was a contented
one. Indeed, nothing could exceed the
urbanity of his demeanour."</p></div>

<p>If this description <i>could</i> be doubted,
on the authority of the volume, it
would be amply confirmed by the
authority of his time. Curran was
confessedly <i>the</i> wit of the day, and
his witticisms were the more popular
from their being, in general, harmless.
No man could sting more keenly
where he had a public culprit of his
own class to sting, or a political adversary
to combat; but no man was
seldomer personal.</p>

<p>Curran's nature was playful. His
taste was also <i>dramatic</i>, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
fond of playing harmless tricks upon
his friends. Of this taste Mr Phillips
had a specimen, even on the day of his
introduction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When the last dish had departed,
Curran totally confounded me with a
proposal for which I was anything but
prepared. 'Mr Phillips,' said he, 'as this
is the first of, I hope, your very many
visits to the Priory, I may as well at
once initiate you into the peculiarities of
the place. You may observe that, though
the board is cleared, there are no preparations
for a <i>symposium</i>; it all depends
on <i>you</i>. My friends here generally prefer
a <i>walk</i> after dinner. It is a sweet evening,
but if <i>you</i> wish for wine, say so without
ceremony.'</p>

<p>"Even now I can see Curran's star-like
eyes twinkling at the disappointment
no doubt visible in mine. I
had heard, and heard truly, that he
never was more delightful than with
half-a-dozen friends after dinner over
his bottle. The hope in which I had
so long revelled was realised at last,
and here came this infernal <i>walk</i>, and
the 'sweet evening.' Oh, how I
would have hailed a thunderstorm!
But, to say the truth, the sun was
shining, and the birds were singing,
and the flowers were blooming and
breathing so sweetly on that autumn
eve, that, wondering not at the wish
of my companions, I also voted for 'the
walk.'</p>

<p>"We took the walk, no doubt, but
it was only to the <i>drawing-room</i>;
where, over a dessert freshly culled
from his gardens, and over wines for
which his board was celebrated, we
passed those hours which seemed an era
in my life."</p></div>

<p>All this is very well told, and very
amusing in description, and was very
innocent&mdash;when all was over. But it
was exposed to the chance of being
differently taken, and had but one
advantage&mdash;that it could not be repeated
on the <i>individual</i>.</p>

<p>Curran was born in 1760 at Newmarket,
a village in the county of
Cork. His parentage was humble,
his father being only the seneschal of
the manor. His mother seems to
have been a woman of superior faculties,
and her celebrated son always
spoke of her with remarkable deference.</p>

<p>As it was a custom, among the
oddities of Ireland, to teach Greek
and Latin to boys who probably were
to spend the rest of their lives at the
spade, Curran had what in Ireland
was called a classical education, but
which his natural talent turned to
better account than one in a million
of those half-naked classicists. It
enriched his metaphors in after life,
and enabled him to talk of the raptures
of antiquity. In the Irish University,
he shared the fate of other
celebrated men. Swift, Burke, and
Goldsmith made no figure in their
academic course. We certainly do
not mention this failure to their
praise, nor would they themselves
have ever so mentioned it. We can
easily conceive, that in their palmiest
days they regretted their waste of
time, or want of industry. Still,
they may have found their palliative
in the ungenial nature of the collegiate
studies in their day. We should
observe, that those studies have
since been more advantageously
adapted to the national necessity, and
are of a much more general and
popular description.</p>

<p>But in the last century, the whole
<i>bent</i> of the collegiate education was
mathematical: the only road to distinction
was Euclid. The value of
mathematics is unquestionable. As
a science, it holds its head among the
highest; but as a national education,
it is among the most useless. The
mind made for mathematical distinction
is as rare as the mind made for
poetic pre-eminence. One might as
well make poetry a requisite, in a
national education, as the mastery of
mathematics. The plea that they
invigorate the reason is contradicted
by perpetual experience. Some of
the feeblest, and even the most fanciful,
and of course the silliest, managers
of great principles, have been mathematicians
of celebrity. Napoleon
said of Laplace, the first mathematician
of his day, to whom he gave a
title and a seat in his Council of
State, on the strength of his scientific
renown, that "he could do
nothing with him,&mdash;that as a public
man he was useless&mdash;that his mind
was full of his <i>infinite littles</i>."
And this is the history of nearly
all mathematical minds: beyond
their diagrams, they are among the
dullest, most circumscribed, and
most incapable of mankind. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
mind of a Newton is not to be ranged
in this class of elaborate mediocrity:
he was not the mole, whose merit consists
in seeing his way in the dark by
an organ which is blind in the broad
light of nature; he was an eagle, and
could dare the full effulgence of the
sun. But this meagre and inapplicable
acquirement was the chosen
prize for the whole young mind of
educated Ireland; her mathematical
crutch was the only instrument of
progress for all the salient spirits of a
nation abounding in the most aspiring
faculties of man, and the quiet drudge
who burrowed his way through Cubics
and Surds, or could keep himself
awake over the reveries of the
<i>Meditationes Analytic&aelig;</i>, was the Coryph&aelig;us
of the College; while men
passed along unnoted, who were in
future years to embody the national
renown.</p>

<p>As Curran's determination was the
Irish Bar, he of course made the
customary visit to the English Inns
of Court. Here, though his finances
compelled him to live in solitude, he
contrived to amuse himself by that
study of which in life he was so
great a master&mdash;the study of character.
Some of his letters from London
are curious indications of this early
tendency of his mind. Curran was
by nature a Tory. <i>All</i> men of genius
are Tories, until they get angry with
the world, or get corrupt, and sell
themselves to Whiggism; or get disgusted,
and think that both parties
are equally worthless.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Here," says Curran, "every coal-porter
is a politician, and vends his
maxims in public with all the importance
of a man who thinks he is exerting himself
for the public service. He claims
the privilege of looking as wise as possible,
and of talking as loud; of damning
the Ministry, and abusing the King, with
less reserve than he would his equal. Yet,
little as those poor people <i>understand the
liberty</i> they so warmly contend for, or of
the <i>measures</i> they rail against, it reconciles
me to their <i>absurdity</i>, by considering
that they are happy, at so small an
expense as being <i>ridiculous</i>."</p></div>

<p>This feeling was too true ever to
have been changed. The <i>language</i>
was changed, and no tongue could
pour out more showy declamation
on the multitude; but, when loosed
from the handcuffs of party, no man
laughed more loudly, or sneered more
contemptuously, at the squalid idol to
which he had so long bowed the knee.</p>

<p>Another fragment has its value in
the illustration of his kindness of
heart:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A portion of my time I have set apart
every day for <i>thinking of my absent friends</i>.
Though this is a duty that does not give
much trouble to many, I have been
obliged to confine it, or endeavour to
confine it, within proper bounds. I have
therefore made a resolution to avoid any
reflections of this sort except in their
allotted season, immediately after dinner.
I am then in a tranquil, happy humour,
and I increase that happiness by presenting
to my fancy those I love, in the most
advantageous point of view. So that,
however severely I treat them when they
intrude in the morning, I make them
ample amends in the evening. I then
assure myself that they are twice as
agreeable, and as wise and as good, as
they really are."</p></div>

<p>Whether the author of <i>Tristram
Shandy</i> would have been a great
orator, if he had begun his career at
the Bar, may be a question; but
that Curran could have written admirable
<i>Shandian</i> chapters can scarcely
be doubted by those who have
observed the exquisite turns of his
speeches from grave to gay; or perhaps
even those who now read the few
words which conclude the story of Dr
du Gavreau. This man was one of his
casual acquaintances, a French fugitive,
who ran away with a Parisian
woman of a different faith. Whether
they married or not is dexterously
veiled. The woman died, leaving a
daughter; but, whether married or
not, their child would have been illegitimate
by the existing laws of
France. The widower had often
been pressed by his friends to return
to France, but he determined never
to return, where his child would be
stigmatised.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I did not know the particulars," says
Curran, "till a few days since, when I
breakfasted with him. He had taken his
little child on his knee, and, after trifling
with her for a few moments, burst into
tears. Such an emotion could not but
excite, as well as justify, some share of
curiosity. The poor Doctor looked as if
he were conscious I felt for him, and his
heart was too full to conceal his affliction.
He kissed his little '<i>orphan</i>,' as
he called her, and then endeavoured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
acquaint me with the lamentable detail.
It was the hardest story in the world to
be told by a man of delicacy. He felt
all the difficulties of it: he had many
things to palliate, some that wanted to
be justified; he seemed fully sensible of
this, yet checked himself when he slided
into anything like defence. I could perceive
the conflict shifting the colours of
his cheek, and I could not but pity him,
and admire him for such an embarrassment.
Yet, notwithstanding all this, he
sometimes assumed all the gaiety of a
Frenchman, and is a very entertaining
fellow."</p></div>

<p>In all these breaks of the story,
and touches of feeling, who but must
recognise the spirit of Sterne?</p>

<p>The volume is a grave volume, and
treats of high things with equal
grace and gravity; but Curran was
an eccentric being, and his true history
must always be mingled with the
comic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have got acquainted," he says,
"with a Miss Hume, who is also an original
in her way. She is a relation of the
celebrated David Hume, and, I suppose
on the strength of her kindred, sets up
for a politician as well as a <i>sceptic</i>. She
has heard his Essays recommended, and
shows her own discernment, by pronouncing
them <i>unanswerable</i>, and talks
of the famous Burke by the familiar
appellation of <i>Ned</i>. Then she is <i>so</i> romantic,
<i>so</i> sentimental! Nothing for <i>her</i>
but goats and purling streams, and piping
shepherds. And, to crown all, it sings
like a nightingale. As I have not the
best command of my muscles, I always
propose putting out the candles <i>before</i>
the song begins, for the greater romanticality
of the thing."</p></div>

<p>Then, as to his relaxations&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You will perhaps be at a loss to
guess what kind of amusement I allow
myself: why, I'll tell you. I spend a
couple of hours every night at a coffee-house,
where I am not a little entertained
with a group of old politicians, who meet
in order to debate on the reports of the
day, or to invent some for the next, <i>with
the other business</i> of the nation! Though
I don't know that society is the characteristic
of this people, yet politics are a
certain introduction to the closest intimacy
of coffee-house acquaintance. I
also visit a variety of ordinaries and eating
houses, and they are equally fertile
in game for a character-hunter. I think
I have found out the cellar where
Roderick Random ate shin of beef for
threepence, and have actually drunk out
of the identical quart which the drummer
squeezed together when poor Strap
spilt the broth on his legs."</p></div>

<p>He visited Hampton Court, and
though he seems to have passed
through its solemn halls and stately
galleries without peculiar remark, he
seized on his <i>game</i> of living character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The servant who showed us the
splendid apartments seemed to be a good
deal pleased with his manner of explaining
a suite of tapestry representing
the Persian war of Alexander. Though
a simple fellow, he had his lesson well
by rote, and ran over the battles of Issus,
Arbela, &amp;c., with surprising fluency.
'But, where is Alexander?' cries Apjohn,
(a young fellow-student, who had accompanied
him.) 'There, sir, at the door of
Darius's tent, with the ladies at his feet.'
'Surely,' said I, '<i>that</i> must be Heph&aelig;stion,
for he was mistaken by the Queen
for Alexander.' 'Pardon me, sir, <i>I hope
I know Alexander better than that</i>.' 'But,
which of the two do you think the greater
man?' 'Greater!&mdash;bless your soul, sir,
they are both dead these <i>hundred years</i>.'"</p></div>

<p>Curran's observation on this official,
or, as he would probably have
called it, <i>ministerial</i> blunder, exhibits,
even in these early days of his mind,
something of the reflective spirit
which afterwards gave such an interest
to his eloquence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Oh, what a comment on human
vanity! There was the marrow of a
thousand folios in the answer. I could
not help thinking at the instant, what a
puzzle that mighty man would be in,
should he appear before a committee from
the Temple of Fame, to claim those
laurels which he thought so much of, and
to be opposed in his demands, though his
competitor were Thersites, or the fellow
who rubbed Bucephalus's heels!"</p></div>

<p>All this is showy if not new; yet,
in defiance even of Curran's authority,
its argument is practically denied by
all human nature. What man ever
acts <i>for</i> the praise of posterity alone?
Present impulses, excited by present
rewards, are the law of the living;
and Alexander charging through the
Granicus, and sweeping the royal
Persian cavalry before him, had probably
a heart as full of the most powerful
impulses, as if he could have
assured himself of the inheritance for
ten thousand years of the plaudits of
the globe. We are also to remember,
that he <i>has</i> inherited the great legacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of fame, to this hour&mdash;that, to the
minds of all the intelligent, he is still
the hero of heroes; that clowns are
not the clients of memory, or the distributors
of renown; and that the
man whose history has already survived
his throne two thousand years,
has exhibited in himself all the distinction
between the perishableness
of power and the immortality of
fame.</p>

<p>In 1775 Curran returned to Ireland,
and after anxiously pondering
on the chances of abandoning Europe,
and seeking fortune in America, as
other eminent men&mdash;Edmund Burke
among the number&mdash;had done before
him, he fixed his fates at home.</p>

<p>This portion of the subject begins
with a high panegyric on the difficult
but attractive profession into which
Curran now threw himself, without
income, connection, or friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is not to be questioned, that to
the Bar of that day the people of Ireland
looked up in every emergency, with the
most perfect reliance on their talent and
their integrity. It was then the nursery
of the parliament and the peerage; there
was scarcely a noble family in the land
that did not enrol its elect in that body,
by the study of law and the exercise of
eloquence to prepare them for the field
of legislative exertion. And there not
unfrequently arose a genius from the
very lowest of the people, who won his
way to the distinctions of the Senate,
and wrested from pedigree the highest
honours and offices of the Constitution."</p></div>

<p>That the Bar was the first body in
the country was incontestible, and
that it often exhibited remarkable
instances of ability is equally known.
But those facts must not be understood
as giving the author's opinion,
that perfection lies in the populace.
All the <i>remarkable</i> persons of their
time in Ireland were men of <i>education</i>,
many of birth, and many of hereditary
fortune. Grattan was the son of a
judge; Flood a man of old family
and estate; Clare, the Chancellor, was
the son of the leader of the Bar, and
began the world with &pound;4000 a-year&mdash;a
sum probably now equal to twice
the amount. The Ponsonbys, the
leading family of Whiggism in Ireland,
were among the first blood and
fortune of the land. Hussey Burgh
was a man of old family and fortune.
The Beresfords were closely allied to
nobility. Plunket and Curran were,
perhaps, those among the leaders the
least indebted to the Heralds' College;
but Plunket was the son of a Presbyterian
minister, and both had received
the best education which Ireland
could give&mdash;both were graduates of
the University.</p>

<p>Of course, nature is impartial in
the distribution of talents, but the
<i>true distinction</i> is in their <i>training</i>.
The Radicalism which fills public life
with vulgarity and faction is wholly
the work of that absence of all early
training, which must be the fate of
men suddenly gathered from the
<i>manual</i> labours of life. We know the
necessity of those labours, but intellectual
superiority must be the work
of another school. The men of eminence
in Ireland were also men of
accomplished general knowledge, and
of classical acquirement, to an amount
seldom found even in the English
Legislature. There was not an assembly
in the world where a happy classical
quotation, or dexterous reference
to antiquity, would be received with
a quicker sense, or a louder plaudit
than in the Irish Parliament.</p>

<p>When the well-known antagonist
of the Romish claims, Dr Duigenan,
a stern-looking and singularly <i>dark-featured</i>
old man, had one night
made a long and learned speech on
the subject, Sir John Doyle wholly
extinguished its effect, by the Horatian
line,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hic <i>niger</i> est, hunc tu <i>Romane</i> caveto."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The House shook with applause, and
the universal laugh drove the doctor
from the field.</p>

<p>On another evening, when the
prince of jesters, Toler, then a chief
supporter of Government, contemptuously
observed, on seeing a smile on
some of the Opposition faces&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dulce est desipere in loco;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>an Opposition member started up
and retorted the quotation, by saying,
"That it was much more applicable
to the conduct and position of the
honourable member and his friends,
and that the true translation was, 'It
is mighty pleasant <i>to play the fool</i>
in a <i>place</i>.'"</p>

<p>The novelty and happiness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
translation disturbed the gravity of
debate for a considerable time.</p>

<p>But those were the gay days of
Ireland. Times of keen anxiety, of
daring change, and of social convulsion,
were already shaping themselves
to the eye of the patriot, and the
true debates on which the fate of the
nation hung were transferred from
parliament to the peasantry, from the
council-room to the cabin, from the
accomplished intelligence and polished
brilliancy of the legislature to the
rude resentment, fierce recollections,
and sullen prejudices of the multitude.
It was on the heath, that Revolution,
like Macbeth, met the disturbing
spirits of the land, and heard the
"All hail, hereafter."</p>

<p>Curran's rapid professional distinctions
were the more remarkable, that
the Irish Bar was aristocratic, to a
degree wholly unknown in England.
If it is true, that this great profession
often leads to the Peerage, in Ireland
the course was reversed, and the Peerage
often derived its chief honours from
its connection with the Bar. The sons
of the first families wore the gown,
and the <i>cedant arma tog&aelig;</i> was more
fully realised in Ireland than it ever
was in Rome.</p>

<p>But few men of condition ever
entered the Army; and in a nation of
habitual passion for publicity, and
proverbial love of enterprise, perhaps
fewer officers were added to the British
service than from the Channel
Islands. This has since been largely
changed, and Ireland, which in the
last century but filled up the rank and
file, has since nobly contributed her
share to the names which register
themselves in the memory of nations.
To Ireland, glorious England and
rescued Europe owe a <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>!</p>

<p>The Church, the usual province of
high families in England, was poor,
feeble, and unpopular in Ireland.
With a few positions of great wealth,
all below was barren: livings of
vast extent, with a meagre population,
and still more meagre income; Romanism
was hourly spreading with
a population, itself spreading until it
had nothing to eat, and embittered
against Protestantism until conversion
became more than a hopeless toil&mdash;an
actual terror. Law was the only
instrument of collecting the clerical
income, and the collector and the
clergyman were involved in one common
obloquy, and often in one common
danger&mdash;a condition of things which
must have largely repelled all those
who had the power of choice.</p>

<p>The mitres were chiefly bestowed
on the Fellows of English colleges,
and tutors of English noblemen.
Every new Viceroy imported a succession
of chaplains, and quartered
them all upon the Irish Church.
The majority of those men looked
upon their position with the nervous
alarm of settlers in the wilderness,
thought only of the common-room
of the colleges from which they had
been torn, or of the noble houses in
which they had been installed; and
reproached the ill luck which had
given them dignities which only excited
popular disgust; and wealth,
from which they could derive no
pleasure, but in its accumulation.
We can scarcely wonder that, through
almost the whole of the eighteenth
century, the Irish Church lay in a
state of humiliation, repulsive to the
public feelings. This, too, has changed;
and the Church now possesses many
able men.</p>

<p>Commerce, which plays so vigorous
a part in the world, was then a
swathed infant in Ireland, and swathed
so tightly by provincial regulations,
that there was scarcely a prospect of
its ever stepping beyond the cradle.
Manufactures&mdash;that gold-mine worth
all the treasures of the Western World&mdash;were
limited to the looms of the
north; and the only manufacture of
three-fourths of this fine country
consisted in the fatal fabrication of
forty-shilling voters.</p>

<p>The Squiredom of Ireland was the
favourite profession of busy idleness,
worthless activity, and festive folly.
But this profession must have an
estate to dilapidate, or a country to
ride over, and English mortgagees to
pamper its prodigality and accelerate
its ruin. Gout, the pistol, broken
necks, and hereditary disease, rapidly
thinned this class. Perpetual litigation
stood before their rent-rolls, in
the shape of a devouring dragon;
and, with a peasantry starving but
cheerful, and with a proprietary pauperised,
but laughing to the last,
they were determined, though hourly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
sinking into bankruptcy, to be ruined
like a <i>gentleman</i>.</p>

<p>All those circumstances coming together,
made the Bar almost the sole
assemblage of the ability of Ireland.
But they also made it the most daring,
dashing, and belligerent body of gentlemen
that Europe has seen. It was
Lord Norbury's remark, in his old
age, when he reposed on the cushions
of the peerage, had realised immense
wealth, and obtained <i>two</i> peerages for
his two sons&mdash;that all this came out
of fifty pounds, and a case of pistols,
his father's sole present as he launched
him in life. The list of duels fought
by the leading members of the Bar
might figure in the returns of a Continental
campaign; and no man was
regarded as above answering for a
sarcasm dropped in court, by his appearance
in the field.</p>

<p>But we must not, from this unfortunate
and guilty habit, conceive that
the spirit of the higher orders of Ireland
was deficient in the courtesies of
life. There was a melancholy cause
in the convulsions of the country.
The war of William III., which had
broken down the throne of James II.,
had left many a bitter feeling among
the Popish families of Ireland. Many
of the soldiers of James had retired
into village obscurity, or were suffered
to retain the fragments of their
estates, and live in that most embittering
of all conditions&mdash;a sense of
birth, with all the struggles of diminished
means. These men indulged
their irritable feelings, or avenged
their ruin, by the continual appeal to
the pistol. Always nurturing the
idea that the victory had been lost
to them solely by the cowardice of
James, they were ready to quarrel
with any man who doubted their
opinion; and as their Protestant conquerors
were brave bold men, equally
disposed to maintain their right, and
unhesitating in their claim to possess
what they had won by their swords,
their quarrels became feuds. Law,
which reprobated the principle, by its
laxity established the practice; and
when lawyers led the way, the community
followed. Still, there can be
no doubt that duelling is a custom
alike contrary to the order of society,
and the <i>command of heaven</i>; and, the
first judge who hangs a duellist as a
murderer, and sends all the parties
engaged in the transaction to the
penal colonies <i>for life</i>, will have
rendered a signal service to his
country.</p>

<p>While every part of this volume is
valuable, for the display of vigorous
writing and manly conception, the
more interesting fragments, to us, are
the characters of the parliamentary
leaders; because such men are the
creators of national character, the
standards of national intellect, and
the memorials to which their nation
justly points as the trophies of national
honour.</p>

<p>The Parliament of Ireland is in the
grave; but, while the statues of her
public orators stand round the tomb,
it must be felt to be more than a
sepulchre. Whatever homage for
genius may be left in the distractions
of an unhappy country, must come to
kneel beside that tomb; and if the
time shall ever arrive for the national
enfranchisement from faction, the first
accents of national wisdom must be
dictated from that sacred depository
of departed virtue.</p>

<p>Grattan, the first man in the
brightest day of the Irish Parliament,
was descended of an honourable
lineage. His father was a barrister,
member of parliament for Dublin, and
also its Recorder. He himself was a
graduate of the Irish University,
where he was distinguished. Entering
the Middle Temple, he was
called to the Irish Bar in 1772.</p>

<p>But his mind was parliamentary;
his study in England had been parliament;
and his spirit was kindled by
the great orators of the time. He
who had beard Burke and Chatham,
had heard the full power of imaginative
oratory&mdash;of all oratory the
noblest. Grattan had the materials
of a great speaker in him by nature&mdash;keen
sensibility, strong passion, daring
sincerity, and an imagination furnished
with all the essential knowledge
for debate&mdash;not overwhelmed by
it, but refreshing the original force of
his mind, like the eagle's wing refreshed
by dipping into the fountain,
but dipping only to soar. Yet, though
almost rapturously admiring those
distinguished men, he was no <i>imitator</i>.
He struck out for himself a line
between both, and, in some of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
happier moments, superior to either;
combining the rich exuberance of
Burke's imagination with Chatham's
condensed dignity of thought. Possessed
of an extraordinary power of
reasoning, Grattan had the not less
extraordinary power of working it
into an intensity which made it glow;
and some of the most elaborate arguments
ever uttered in Parliament
have all the brilliancy of eloquence.
He continually <i>reasoned</i>, though the
most metaphorical of speakers; and
this combination of logic and lustre,
though so unusual in others, in <i>him</i>
was characteristic. He poured out
arguments like a shower of arrows,
but they were all arrows tipped with
fire.</p>

<p>Mr Phillips' sketch of him brings
Grattan before us to the life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He was short in stature, and unprepossessing
in appearance. His arms
were disproportionately long. His walk
was a stride. With a person swaying
like a pendulum, and an abstracted air,
he seemed always in thought, and each
thought provoked an attendant gesticulation.
Such was the outward and
visible form of one whom the passenger
would stop to stare at as a droll, and the
philosopher to contemplate as a study.
How strange it is that a mind so replete
with grace and symmetry, and power and
splendour, should have been allotted such
a dwelling for its residence! Yet so it
was, and so also was it one of his highest
attributes, that his genius, by its 'excessive
light,' blinded his hearers to his
physical imperfections. It was the
victory of mind over matter."</p></div>

<p>It is then stated that, even while
at the Temple, he exercised himself
in parliamentary studies, and made
speeches in his walks in Windsor
Forest, near which he had taken
lodgings, and in his chamber. Of
course, he was supposed to be a little
mad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"His landlady observed, 'What a sad
thing it was to see the poor young gentleman
all day talking to somebody he calls
Mr Speaker, when there was no speaker
in the house but himself.' Nor was the
old lady singular in her opinion. In
some few years afterwards, no less a man
than Edmund Burke wrote over to Ireland,
'Will no one stop that madman,
Grattan?' Assuredly when Burke himself
enacted the dagger-scene on the
floor of the House of Commons, the
epithet was more applicable."</p></div>

<p>We refer to this remark, chiefly
to correct a misconception generally
adopted. It has been supposed that
Burke, to heighten the effect of his
speech on the discontents then engendering
against the State, actually
purchased a dagger, to throw on the
floor of Parliament. This, of course,
would have been ridiculous; and it is
to do the common duty of rescuing
the fame of a great man from the
slightest touch of ridicule that this
explanation is given. One of his
friends (we believe, a member of
Parliament) had received, in the
course of the day, from Birmingham,
a newly-invented dagger, of a desperate
kind, of which some <i>thousands</i> had
been ordered, evidently for the purpose
of <i>assassination</i>. Burke, naturally
shocked at this proof of the
sanguinary designs spreading among
the lower population, took the weapon
with him, to convince those who constantly
scoffed at him as an <i>alarmist</i>
that his alarms were true. The
whole was a matter of accident; nothing
could be less premeditated;
and every hearer of the true statement
will agree that, so far from
being a theatrical exhibition, it was
the very act which any rational and
manly man would have done. The
time was terrible: revolution threatened
every hour. Jacobinism was
hourly boasting that it had the
Church and Throne in its grasp; and,
at such a period, the positive statement
of a man like Burke, that thousands
(we believe five thousand) of
weapons, evidently made for private
<i>murder</i>, were actually ordered in one
of our manufacturing towns, and the
sight of one of those horrid instruments
itself, was an important call
on the vigilance of Government, and
a salutary caution to the country.
It is not at all improbable that this
act crushed the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Mr Phillips observes, that when
Burke wrote "that madman Grattan,
the <i>madman</i> was contemplating
the glorious future; his ardent mind
beheld the vision of the country he so
loved rising erect from the servitude of
centuries, 'redeemed, regenerated, and
disenthralled' by his exertions. Nor
was that vision baseless&mdash;he made of it a
proud and grand reality: her chains fell
off, as at the bidding, of an enchanter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Grattan's influence in Parliament
was felt from his first entrance. But
he earned it in the only way in which
even genius can be <i>permanently</i> successful.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"His industry was indomitable. The
affairs of Parliament were to be thenceforth
the business of his life, and he
studied them minutely. The chief difficulty
in this great speaker's way was the
first five minutes. During his exordium,
laughter was imminent. He bent his
body almost to the ground, swung his
arms over his head, up and down and
around him, and added to the grotesqueness
of his manner a hesitating tone and
drawling emphasis. Still there was an
earnestness about him, that at first besought,
and, as he warmed, enforced&mdash;nay,
commanded attention."</p></div>

<p>His first entrance into the British
House of Commons is described with
the same graphic effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He had said of Flood 'that he forgot
that he was an oak of the forest, too old
and too great to be transplanted at fifty.'
And yet here he was himself. Whether he
would take root was the question, and
for some moments very questionable it
was. When he rose, every voice in that
crowded House was hushed; the great
rivals, Pitt and Fox, riveted their eyes
upon him; he strode forth and gesticulated&mdash;the
hush became unanimous; not
a cheer was heard; men looked in one
another's faces, and then at the phenomenon
before them, as if doubting his
identity. At last, and on a sudden, the
indication of the master-spirit came.
Pitt was the first generously to recognise
it. He smote his thigh hastily with his
hand&mdash;it was an impulse when he was
pleased&mdash;his followers saw it, and knew
it, and with a universal burst they hailed
the advent and the triumph of the
stranger."</p></div>

<p>Grattan was sincere, and this sincerity
gave at once substance to his
popularity, and power to his eloquence.
But, as a politician, he was
rash; and as a prophet, he had to
see the failure of all his predictions.
He wielded a torch of exceeding
brightness, it is true; but the torch at
once blinded himself and inflamed
the nation. His patriotism was pure,
but it wanted practicability. He left
no great measure of public utility
behind him. His liberation, as he
called it, of Ireland in 1782, was a
showy fiction, to end in the disgrace
of a painful discovery. It was the
<i>liberation</i> of a fever to end in exhaustion;
of a dream of opulence and
independence, to finish in an awaking
of poverty and despair. Its closest
resemblance was to the late festival
at the Hanwell Asylum&mdash;an assemblage
of lunatics dressed for the night
in feathers and flowers, dancing and
feasting, until the morning light sent
them back to their cells, and the
drudgery of their melancholy discipline.</p>

<p>The whole policy of the Whig
party in Ireland was the counterpart
of their policy in England, only on a
smaller scale. It was, to the performances
of Fox and Opposition here,
what the little stage-play in <i>Hamlet</i>
is to the tragedy itself&mdash;the same
characters and the same crime performed
in imitation of the larger guilt
that gazes on it. The wretched shortsightedness
of supporting any demand
of the populace whom they at once deluded
and despised; the perpetual agitation
to give the franchise to classes
who <i>must</i> use it without the power
of discrimination, and who must be
careless of it but for the purposes of
corruption; the reckless clientship of
the Popish claims, ending in the sale
of Irish independence by the Papists;
the universal conspiracy, and the
sanguinary civil war, followed by the
political suicide of the Parliament&mdash;<i>all</i>
the direct and rapid results of the
Whig policy in Ireland&mdash;show either
the headlong ignorance or the scandalous
hypocrisy of Irish faction.</p>

<p>Yet, in all this blaze of fraud and
falsehood, the name of Grattan was
never degraded by public suspicion.
He was an enthusiast; and his robe
of enthusiasm, like one of the fire-resisting
robes of antiquity, came out
only brighter for its passing through
the flame. But the Legislature (all
impurities) was left in ashes.</p>

<p>Mr Phillips seems to regret Grattan's
transfer to England, as an injury
to his oratorical distinctions. He
tells us "that it is in the Irish Parliament,
and in his younger day, that
his finest efforts are to be found!"
Reluctant as we are to differ from
such an authority, yet, judging from
his <i>published</i> speeches, it appears
to us that his powers never found
their right position until they were
within the walls of the British Par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>liament.
These walls shut out the
roar of the populace, which disturbed
him, but to which he once must listen.
These walls sheltered him from that
perpetual clinging of Popery, which
dragged down his fine tastes to its
own level. Within these walls, he
was relieved from the petty interests
of partisanship, and raised from the
feuds of an island to the policy of an
empire. In Ireland, popularity required
perpetual submission to the
caprices of the multitude, and no man
had more fully felt than Grattan the
impossibility of taking a stand on his
own principles&mdash;he must be either on
the shoulders of the mob, or under
their heels. In England, no longer
wearied with the responsibility of
leading parties who refused to be
guided, or the disgust of following his
inferiors through the dust of their
hurried "road to ruin," he had before
him, and embraced with the gallantry
of his nature, the great Cause for
which England was fighting&mdash;the
cause of human kind. In Ireland,
Grattan, with all his intrepidity,
would not have dared to make his
magnificent speech on the war with
Napoleon, or, if he had, would have
been denounced by the roar of the
million. In England, he was in the
midst of the noblest associations; he
was surrounded by all the living ability
of the empire; and if genius itself
is to be inspired by the memories of
the mighty, every stone of the walls
round him teemed with inspiration.</p>

<p>Thus, if his language was more
chastened, it was loftier; if his metaphors
were more disciplined, they
were more majestic;&mdash;the orb which,
rising through the mists of faction,
had shone with broadened disc and
fiery hue, now, in its meridian, assumed
its perfect form, and beamed
with its stainless glory.</p>

<p>In recording the remarkable names
of this period in Ireland, Mr Phillips
alludes to the celebrated preacher,
Dean Kirwan:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He had been a Roman Catholic clergyman,
but conformed to the Church of
England. He was a wonderful orator&mdash;one
of the greatest that ever filled a pulpit;
and yet, when injudicious friends,
after his death, published a volume of his
sermons, they were scarcely readable.
This sounds paradoxical: but it is true.
The volume is not remembered&mdash;those
who heard the preacher never can forget
him. It was my happiness to have the
opportunity thrice, while a student in the
University of Dublin. The church, on
those occasions, presented a singular,
and, in truth, not a very decorous spectacle&mdash;a
bear-garden was orderly compared
to it. The clothes were torn off
men's backs&mdash;ladies were carried out
fainting&mdash;disorder the most unseemly disgraced
the entire service, and so continued
till Kirwan ascended the pulpit.
What a change was there then! Every
eye was turned to him&mdash;every tongue was
hushed&mdash;all was solemn silence. His
enunciation of the Lord's Prayer was one
of the finest things ever heard. Never
before or since did mortal man produce
such wonderful effect. And yet he had
his disadvantages to overcome: his person
was not imposing; he was somewhat
wall-eyed; and his voice at times was
inharmonious."</p></div>

<p>We see in this striking portrait the
writer <i>con amore</i>, and we must give him
due credit for his vivid tribute to Irish
ability. But there are few miracles
in this world, and the fact that Kirwan's
printed sermons are wholly inferior
to his reputation reduces our
wonder within more restricted bounds.
If it is true, that much emotion is lost
by the loss of the actual speaking;
that the full power of the oratory is
somewhat diminished by its being
calmly read, instead of being ardently
heard; still we have but few instances,
perhaps none, where true oratory altogether
loses its power in publication.</p>

<p>For example, Curran's published
speeches give the general reader a
very sufficient specimen of the richness
of his language, the fertility of
imagination, and even the subtlety of
his humour. Grattan's speeches,
most of them mere fragments, and
probably few published with his revision,
give the full impression of his
boldness of thought, depth of argument,
and exquisite pungency of expression.
Burke's printed speeches
are even said to give a higher sense of
his wonderful ability than when they
were delivered in the House of Commons.
There is an anecdote that,
when Pitt had read one of those
earlier speeches in the form of a pamphlet,
he expressed his astonishment.
"Is it possible," he exclaimed, "that
this fine oration <i>can be</i> what we heard
the other night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>That Kirwan's preaching was
attended by immense congregations is
unquestionable; and that his collections
were very large is equally true.
But there were circumstances remarkably
in favour of both. He
preached but three or four times in
the year, and he never preached but
for charities patronised by the highest
personages of the land. The Lord-lieutenant
and the principal nobility
were generally the patrons of those
especial charities. There was this
additional advantage, that then poor-laws
in Ireland were unknown, and
public liberality was thus the more
urgently required, and the more
willingly exercised. The day of his
preaching was in general an <i>anniversary</i>;
for which the whole preceding
year was a preparation; and the collection
was thus, in a certain degree,
the payment of a rent.</p>

<p>The magnitude of his collections
has been the subject of some erroneous
conjectures. On the occasion
of his preaching for the families of the
yeomanry who fell in the rebellion of
1798&mdash;a memorable and melancholy
occasion, which naturally called forth
the national liberality&mdash;the collection
was said to have amounted to a thousand
pounds. A very large sum, but
it was a national contribution.</p>

<p>Kirwan's style of delivery, too, had
some share in his popular effect&mdash;he
<i>recited</i> his sermons in the manner of
the French preachers; and the
novelty formed a striking contrast
to the dreary reading of the ordinary
preachers. He was also fond of
lashing public transgressions, and the
vices of high life were constantly the
subject of sharp remarks, which even
stooped to the dresses of the women.
The nobility, accordingly, came to
hear themselves attacked; and, as all
personality was avoided, they came
to be amused.</p>

<p>Still, Kirwan was a remarkable
man, and worthy of mention in any
volume which treats of the memorable
personages of Ireland.</p>

<p>We wish that we could avoid
speaking of his treatment by the
Church dignitaries of his time. While
they ought to have received such a
convert with honour, they seem to
have made a point of neglecting him.
He was not merely a man of talent
in the pulpit, but alike accomplished
in science and elegant literature;
for he had been successively <i>Professor</i>
of Rhetoric, and of Natural Philosophy,
in (if we recollect rightly)
the College of Louvain, at a time
when French Mathematics were the
pride of the Continent.</p>

<p>Yet he never obtained preferment
or countenance, and scarcely even
civility, except the extorted civility of
fear, from any of the ecclesiastical heads
of Ireland. The dull and common-place
men, with whom it was then
customary to fill the Irish Sees,
shrank from one who might have been
a most willing, as he must have been a
most able, instrument in reconciling
his Papist countrymen to the Church
of England. And, without any other
cause than their own somnolent
stupidity, they rendered wholly useless&mdash;as
far as was in their power&mdash;a
man who, in a position corresponding
to his ability, might have headed a
New Reformation in Ireland.</p>

<p>Kirwan's only dignity was given to
him by the Lord-lieutenant, Cornwallis,
after nearly fifteen years of
thankless labour; and it consisted
only of the poor Deanery of Killala,
a nook on the savage shore of
Western Ireland. He died soon
after, of a <i>coup-de-soleil</i>&mdash;as it was
observed the natural death of a man
of his genius!</p>

<p>But we must break off from this
captivating volume. We recollect
no political work in which politics
are treated with more manly propriety,
or personal character delineated
with more vigorous truth; in
which happier anecdotes abound, or
in which the writer gives his own
opinion with more firmness, yet with
less offence to public feelings. From
its evident knowledge of Ireland, it
could be written by none but an
Irishman; but its sentiments are cosmopolite.
If the author sails under
his national flag, still, his bark must
be recognised as a noble vessel, and
welcome in any Port of the World.</p>

<h2>LORD HOLLAND'S FOREIGN REMINISCENCES.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h2>


<p>There is no pleasanter kind of reading
than a good personal memoir.
Works of this description serve a
double purpose; for they not only
convey to us most lively impressions
of society, illustrated with portraits
of the most eminent and remarkable
men of the time, but, taken in the
aggregate, they furnish the best and
most authentic store of materials
available to the future historian.
Ponderous or brilliant, gossiping or
grave, according to the peculiar style
and idiosyncrasy of their writers,
they have all claims to our notice;
and more than one posthumous reputation
has been achieved through
compositions such as these, by men
whose other labours have failed to
attract the slightest share of the
public notice or approbation.</p>

<p>But even in this light walk of
literature, there are certain conditions
which must be observed, in order to
excite interest and to insure success.
We expect from the compiler
of memoirs a narrative, however
desultory, of what passed before his
own observation. He must not be
altogether a reporter at second-hand&mdash;a
mere relater of stories or scandals
which he has chanced to pick up
from others&mdash;a dilator, through simple
hearsay, of closet or antechamber
gossip. The substance at least of
his tale must be derived from his personal
knowledge, else we have no
voucher at all for the authenticity
of what he is pleased to relate. The
memoirs, in short, must be his own, not
fragments from those of other people.</p>

<p>The announcement of the publication
of a volume of Memoirs or Reminiscences
from the pen of the late Lord
Holland could hardly have failed to
stimulate the public curiosity. His
known intimacy with many of the
leading characters of the last generation,
his near relationship to the most
conspicuous of modern Whig statesmen,
his inclination towards letters&mdash;which
made him appear the centre of
a certain literary coterie&mdash;were all so
many distinct pledges for the value of
his literary legacy. True, Byron in
his early satire had irreverently
scoffed at the reunions of Holland
House, and thrown no slight degree
of ridicule on the fame of that rising
academy; but the satire served at
the same time to commemorate the
hospitality of the noble M&aelig;cenas.
We observe that a critic in the last
number of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> is
still magniloquent on this theme.
With the savour of past banquets
still lingering in his nostrils, he manfully
declares his intention of being
impartial, nay stern, in the execution
of his censorial duty; and attempts to
persuade us, as he is persuaded himself,
"that the very prepossessions
which we feel, and have endeavoured
to describe, have been disadvantageous
rather than favourable to the
author." If so, the inevitable conclusion
must be, that the critic is a monster
of ingratitude. Had he contented
himself with simply stating that no
amount of dinners, no extent of
hospitalities received, should influence
his judgment one whit in favour of
the book, the declaration, with some
due allowance of course for the frailties
of human nature, might have
been accepted. But when he tells us
that, <i>because</i> he was a guest at the
table of the late Lord Holland, and
admitted, as he insinuates, to his
intimacy, his prepossessions are disadvantageous
to the author, he is either
writing egregious nonsense, or conveying
the reverse of a compliment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Had the work," says he, "been
anonymous, or had it proceeded&mdash;like
many of those innumerable books miscalled
histories&mdash;from the Palais Royal
or the quays of Paris, we are inclined to
think that a more favourable judgment
might have been formed of it, than when
every sentence, nay, almost every line, is
weighed against the high reputation of
the author, and the anticipations of
readers <i>like ourselves</i>."</p></div>

<p>The majority of the reading public,
however, are by no means in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>exalted position of the critic, who, by
the way, was under no obligation
whatever to review the book, if, on
perusal, he found its contents fall
greatly short of his expectations.
What he means by talking about
publications issuing "from the Palais
Royal or the quays of Paris" we
cannot exactly divine, unless he
wishes us to understand that the
<i>Foreign Reminiscences</i> intrinsically
belong to the same class of writings&mdash;an
opinion in which we
thoroughly agree. Such twaddle as
this is altogether superfluous. The
public generally has no prepossession
either the one way or the other. The
name of Lord Holland is known to
them as that of a man who moved in
a distinguished sphere of society, and
who must, in his own day, have seen
much which was worth narrating.
They have no means of weighing his
conversation against his writings;
they accept the latter when laid before
them, and will judge of them strictly
according to their actual value.</p>

<p>It appears that the present volume
constitutes but a small part of Lord
Holland's written Memoirs. The reason
why it is given to us at the present
time is set forth in the Preface, which,
being short, we transcribe entire.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The recent events on the Continent
have induced the editor to publish the
following pages on foreign politics. The
time of which this volume treats has
already acquired the interest of a long
past age; and the public will read with
pleasure, and perhaps with profit, the
observations on passing events of a contemporary
who, if not wholly impartial,
is acknowledged by all who knew him
to have been as candid as he was benevolent.</p>

<p>"The editor has scrupulously abstained
from making the slightest verbal alteration
in the text or notes. The omission
of four insignificant sentences is all that
he has deemed necessary for the immediate
publication of what was probably
written with the intention of not seeing
the light so soon."</p></div>

<p>We must fairly confess that this
preface stimulated our curiosity still
further. From it we understood that
the <i>Reminiscences</i> were to have
some practical bearing upon the events
which have taken place on the Continent
during the last three years&mdash;that
they would throw some additional
light upon the causes which have led
to so many dynastic convulsions.
Our disappointment therefore was
proportionably great, when, on perusing
the work, we discovered that
not a single page of it was calculated
to assist us in any such researches,
and that even the observations on
passing events were of the most
meagre and unsatisfactory description.
What especial purpose the publication
of this volume, apart from the
remainder of the Memoirs, could serve
at the present, or indeed at any other
time, we are wholly at a loss to conceive.
It treats of no topic which
has not been long ago exhausted,
contains hardly any personal narrative,
and affords us not one single
atom of novel information. As a
repertory of anecdotes it is singularly
worthless. We allude to such anecdotes
as may be considered authentic,
or at least tolerably so&mdash;anecdotes,
for example, communicated to the
author by Talleyrand, and one or two
other foreign statesmen with whom,
in later years, he was acquainted.
But there is another class of anecdotes,
or pseudo-anecdotes, which we
cannot pass over even with so slight
a censure. We allude to the revelations
of private intrigue, on which the
author dwells with a zest which to
us seems peculiarly offensive. Until
we saw this volume, we could not
have believed that one British peer
would have penned, and another
have published, such a tissue of
scandals, emanating from discarded
serving-women and court menials,
and reflecting directly on the honour
of some of the first houses of
Europe. We are at no loss to discover
where the omissions mentioned
in the preface are made, or what was
the nature of the passages expunged.
It would perhaps have been better,
where the inuendo is retained, to
have preserved the details, in order
that they might have been strictly
tested. It is, we think, no proper
concession to delicacy to find lines of
asterisks following a direct charge
against the virtue of Marie Antoinette,
or the legitimacy of the Duchess of
York; or to have a page of such mysterious
symbols inserted immediately
after the notice of the marriage of Ferdinand
VII. of Spain. Lord Holland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
should have been allowed to tell his
own story, if not in justice to the
memory of the ladies whose chastity
is called in question, at least that we
know the true bent of the
imagination of the noble author, and
appreciate "that humorous pleasantry,
guided by good sense and
wisdom, and raised above vulgar irony
or personality," which his eulogist in
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> is pleased to
claim as his attributes. It is difficult
to understand why, in one case, there
should be an evident suppression,
whilst, in another, anecdotes of an
offensive nature, reflecting
upon the conduct of a queen, are
printed without the slightest reserve,
introduced in the following highly
satisfactory manner:&mdash;"A story was
current at Madrid, which, <i>if true</i>,
would at once prove that the Prince
of the Peace was aware of her infidelities,"
&amp;c., and followed by this commentary&mdash;"the
anecdote is, perhaps,
too dramatic to deserve implicit
credit." If so, why was it written
down, and why is it now published?
The appetite for prurient details
which is a main feature of this book,
is perhaps intelligible when it relates
to intrigues notorious to all the world.
No man of a really refined or fastidious
mind would have committed
these details to paper, more especially
when they bore reference to the
family of an individual with whom he
was on something like intimate terms.
But the case is far worse, and can
admit of no palliation, when we find
the most infamous charges, which
have never been supported by even a
shadow of proof, deliberately revived
and repeated against that heroic and
unfortunate lady, Queen Marie Antoinette
of France. If the lament of
Burke for the wane of chivalry was
felt, not as a brilliant diatribe, but as
a cutting sarcasm at the time when it
was first enunciated, how much more
appropriate is it now, when we find
that a member of the British peerage&mdash;a
man thought to be distinguished
for high sentiment and generous sympathy&mdash;did
not hesitate to adopt in
the solitude of his closet the shameless
inventions of the French revolutionary
rabble; and that these are now
given as facts which will not admit of
questioning or denial to the world!</p>

<p>We are extremely glad to observe
that the writer in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> has had the proper spirit to
refute&mdash;and he does it most satisfactorily&mdash;this
wretched and scandalous
attack upon the memory of a royal
lady. It was not perhaps to be
expected that he should do more;
but what sort of imputation does his
vindication of the Queen leave upon
the character of her assailant? This
is not a matter which should be passed
over lightly; and for our part we feel
bound to say that we can conceive no
spectacle more pitiable or humiliating,
than that of an old man
committing with a palsied hand to
paper the prurient rumours of the
past. Had the evidence against
Marie Antoinette been ten times
stronger than it was, honour and
the feelings of a gentleman should
have deterred any one even from repeating
the accusation. But the late
Lord Holland entertained no such
scruples. His witness, at second-hand,
is the very woman who wrote
<i>M&eacute;moires sur la Vie Priv&eacute;e de Marie
Antoinette, Reine de France</i>; and in
these memoirs of hers there is not
even an inuendo against the honour of
the unfortunate Queen. But Madame
Campan cannot so escape. Lord Holland
was determined that she should,
in some way or other, assist in blackening
the reputation of her royal mistress;
and accordingly we are treated
to the following ingenuous note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Madame Campan's delicacy and discretion
are not only pardonable, but
praiseworthy; but they are disingenuous,
and her Memoirs conceal truths well
known to her, though such as would have
been unbecoming a lady to reveal. She
was, in fact, the <i>confidante</i> of Marie Antoinette's
amours. These amours were
not numerous, scandalous, or degrading,
but they <i>were amours</i>. Madame Campan,
who lived beyond the Restoration, was
not so mysterious in conversation on
these subjects as she is in her writings.
She acknowledged to persons, who have
acknowledged it to me, that she was
privy to the intercourse between the
Queen and the Duc de Coigny."</p></div>

<p>And this is evidence upon which we
are to condemn Marie Antoinette! I
had it&mdash;says this distinct and confident
accuser&mdash;from other people, who had
it from the waiting-woman, although
the waiting-woman knew better than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
write it down! And who were the
people "who acknowledged it to
me"&mdash;what was their character and
station&mdash;what was their repute for
credibility? Lord Holland durst not
in his lifetime have said as much of
the father or mother of any man of
his acquaintance upon such a pretext
for authority. It is altogether the
very worst instance of a wanton attack
which we ever remember to have met
with: it has but one parallel in history&mdash;the
famous warming-pan legend,
by means of which Lord Holland's
political predecessors sought to bastardise
the son of James II. But the motive
which dictated the earlier fiction
is wanting in the case of the later one.</p>

<p>Let us not be misunderstood. The
case stands thus: Lord Holland has
made a grievous charge against the
honour of the murdered Queen of
France. He says that he believes
that charge to be true, and he states
the grounds of his belief. They are
these: A lady, who wrote the memoirs
of her mistress's private life,
in which no hint of criminal conduct
appears, told other persons (who are
nameless) who told him, Lord Holland,
that the Queen had been guilty
of adultery. Far be it from us to
doubt the honour of a British peer.
But, rather than doubt the honour of
Marie Antoinette, we should doubt
the fact of Lord Holland having received
any such statement from any
human being. Who were the indiscreet
friends of Madame Campan that
conveyed to his ear the hitherto undivulged
secret? Were they old
menials of the French court&mdash;retired
waiting-women&mdash;confidential lacqueys&mdash;or
persons who had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
to Holland House? Surely, when
the honour of a Queen is impeached,
we are entitled to know the authority.
No authority of any kind is given.
On the <i>ipse dixit</i> of Lord Holland rests
the entire substantiation of the charge,
and on his memory must lie the stigma
of having revived the gross and unmanly
calumny.</p>

<p>We have felt ourselves bound to say
this much, because, if stories of this
sort are to be accepted as authentic
contributions to history, there is no
imaginable kind of falsehood which
may not be promulgated as truth.
Apply the rule to private life, and
the malignity of a discarded butler
would be sufficient to taint the best
blood in England. What would we
think of memoirs, compiled by some
man of considerable standing and
celebrity, and published under the
editorship of his son, which should
tell us that the present inheritor of
any noble title was a bastard and an
intruder, on such authority as this&mdash;that
somebody had told the writer,
that somebody else had told him or
her, that she was cognisant of a certain
intrigue? Yet the two cases are
much the same. If they differ at all,
it is in this particular, that the original
testimony of the "somebody,"
who in the instance of the Queen of
France was Madame Campan, happens
to be written and published,
and to contain no insinuation whatever;
whereas, in the case we have
supposed, that negative vindication
would almost certainly be wanting.
Who, we ask, would dare, on such
authority, to set down such accusations
against any private family?
and, if we are right in thinking that
public indignation would most certainly
overwhelm the retailer of such
miserable calumny, why should any
other rule be applied when royalty is
the subject of the attack?</p>

<p>We suspect that Lord Holland's
political friends will hardly thank his
successor for the publication of this
volume. It exhibits the late peer in
what we must suppose to be his true
colours, not as a constitutional Whig,
nor as in any way attached to the
recognised forms of the British Constitution,
but as an admirer of principles
which would necessarily tend to
its overthrow. We have searched the
work in vain for a single expression
of anything which we can venture to
designate as patriotic feeling. Kings
and courts are condemned by him&mdash;what
sympathy he has is bestowed on
the agents of revolution&mdash;and he appears
a eulogist, or at least apologist,
of the very man whom Whig and Tory
alike have agreed in branding with reprobation.
The conduct of "Egalit&eacute;,"
in voting for the death of his cousin,
Louis XVI., appears to him not unnatural.
He takes great pains to
convince us that the infamous duke
was an exceedingly maligned person;
and, with characteristic judgment as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to the nature of his evidence, cites "a
short narrative written by Mrs
Elliott, who had, I believe, lived
with him," as an apology for an act
which, even in the French Revolutionary
Convention, called forth an
exclamation of horror.</p>

<p>Lord Holland's personal experiences&mdash;we
should rather call them
reminiscences&mdash;connected with the
French Revolution, were very
meagre. He was then, (in 1791,) as
he tells us, a mere boy, and not
likely to have much cognisance of the
state of political affairs. In consequence,
we gain absolutely nothing
from his observation. Neither was
his sojourn in Prussia, during the ensuing
year, more fruitful save in the
article of scandal, of which we have
said enough. The same remark will
apply to his Spanish tour; from the
records of which, if we abstract the
personal and indecent details, not one
word of interest remains. This
strikes us as very singular. A young
and well-educated man, traversing
those countries at a time when
they widely differed in their aspect
and forms of society from those
which they afterwards assumed,
ought surely to have preserved some
"Reminiscences" of their condition,
which would have been more acceptable
to posterity than stories of
court adultery, which he hardly could
have derived from any creditable
source; and we fairly confess that
the total omission of anything
like practical details, goes far to convince
us that Byron's early judgment
was right, and that the fame of Holland
House rested far more upon the
Amphytrionic, than the natural or
acquired accomplishments of the distinguished
host. In fact, were it not
remarkable for such disgraceful scandal
as would lower the character of a
theatrical green-room, the first half of
this volume is entirely beneath contempt.
It has nothing whatever to
do with the present crisis of affairs&mdash;it
refers in no way to national or
dynastical interests&mdash;it is simply a
collection of such trash as, thirty
years ago, might have been published
under the auspices of a noble name,
and then have descended to the hands
of the trunk-maker, without the slightest
chance of a second resurrection.</p>

<p>But the other half of the volume
remains yet to be noticed. It is
devoted exclusively to the Emperor
Napoleon Buonaparte, whom Lord
Holland appears to have regarded
with the most profound admiration.
We approached this part of the book
with sharpened curiosity, hoping to
find recorded some additional traits of
that remarkable character; but again
we were doomed to disappointment.
Lord Holland's personal recollections
of the Emperor are contained in the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Both Lady Holland and myself were
presented to him in 1802, when he was
First Consul. He saw her only once, and
addressed some usual questions and compliments
to her, but had no conversation;
though I have reason to believe that he
was aware of the admiration she entertained
and avowed for his military and
political genius. I stood next to him in
the circle when he received and answered,
in a short written speech, (hastily, and
somewhat awkwardly delivered,) the
deputation headed by Barthelemi, which
came to confer upon him the consulship
for life. He spoke very civilly, but very
little to me on that occasion; and
scarcely more when I dined and passed
the evening at his court, in company
with Mr Fox, with whom he conversed at
considerable length on various matters,
and more particularly on the Concordat.
These were the only opportunities I ever
had of observing his countenance or
hearing his voice. The former, though
composed of regular features, and both
penetrating and good-humoured, was
neither so dignified nor so animated as I
had expected; but the latter was sweet,
spirited, and persuasive in the highest
degree, and gave a favourable impression
of his disposition as well as of his
understanding. His manner was neither
affected nor assuming, but certainly
wanted that ease and attraction which
the early habits of good company are
supposed exclusively to confer."</p></div>

<p>Interchanges of civilities, however,
continued to take place. Lady Holland
transmitted to the Emperor,
when at Elba, "one or two packets of
English newspapers," and these little
acts of attention were acknowledged
by "some small but curious specimens
of the iron ore of that island."
Her Ladyship's subsequent solicitude
for the comforts of Napoleon, when
exiled at St Helena, and her generous
attention to his wants, are well known,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and exhibit, in a most pleasing manner,
the kindliness of the female heart.
The mention of these things leads to
an account of the Longwood squabbles,
the interest of which has now entirely
passed away. Sir Hudson Lowe may
not have been the most courteous or
<i>debonnaire</i> of wardens, but, on the
other hand, it is clear that Napoleon
would have made a point of quarreling
with an angel of light if appointed
as his <i>custos</i>; and that the last passages
of his life by no means exhibit
him in a dignified or magnanimous
point of view. As, however, the
narrative to which we refer is one of
the few in this volume which are based
upon Lord Holland's own experience,
we may as well insert it here as a
specimen of the author's style.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"When the ungenerous decision by
which this great prisoner was to be conveyed
to St Helena was known, Lady
Holland hastened to apply to Government
for permission to send such articles as in
her judgment were likely to contribute
to his comfort or amusement in that distant
exile. She improved her slight
acquaintance with Sir Hudson Lowe,
and, by every civility in her power, endeavoured
to obtain from him all the
facilities consistent with his duty, and
instructions for carrying her intentions
into execution. She failed in both these
attempts. Lord Bathurst informed her
that no present could be sent to General
Buonaparte, but that Government would
willingly purchase and convey to him any
article that could be suggested as conducive
to his comfort. Lady Holland
happened to know that the Emperor liked,
even in less sultry climates, to drink both
water and wine extremely cold. She
had been on the point of buying, at a
considerable price, a newly-invented
machine for making ice; and, in answer
to Lord Bathurst's message, she gave
him the direction of the maker, and suggested
the purchase. The machine, however,
was neither purchased nor sent.
Lady Holland nevertheless persisted, and
contrived to send, together with new
publications and trifling presents to Sir
Hudson, similar marks of remembrance
to Napoleon. They were often delayed,
from excessive scruple or from less
pardonable motives, at the Government
House; yet the innocent nature of the
memorials themselves secured their ultimately
reaching their destination. Various
obstacles, however, presented themselves
to this insignificant intercourse.
A natural and pardonable pride deterred
Napoleon from applying for anything; a
more mistaken, and in my judgment contemptible,
punctilio led him to reject any
communication in which his title of
Emperor was not preserved. Advantage
was taken of such circumstances&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>No; in mercy to the compositors,
we shall not go on with this! The
pen drops from the fingers, and a
drowsy sense of numbness steals
upon the brain in the mere act of
transcribing these ponderous and
most prosy sentences. Skip we a
couple of pages still occupied by the
recital of such unutterable woes, and
let us arrive at the period of better
treatment&mdash;"the effect, I flatter
myself, of my motion in the House of
Lords."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Letters from the Emperor's family,
intrusted to the Secretary of State, were
henceforward more regularly transmitted.
Provisions, clothing, and books,
purchased by them, and sent to the
same office, were also forwarded; and
Lord Bathurst, some time afterwards,
not only consented to convey articles
from Lady Holland to Napoleon and
Sir Hudson Lowe, but apprised her
regularly of ships that sailed for St
Helena, and, after due experience of
her scrupulous adherence to the rules
which he imposed, allowed all parcels,
books, and cases indorsed with her
handwriting and name, to proceed, without
further inspection, to their destination.
Lady Holland had the satisfaction
of knowing that many of those articles
were received and approved of. Napoleon
never wrote, but he mentioned her
name and her attentions more than once
to persons who repeated his acknowledgments
to her. The legacy was,
however, a gratifying, and, by her, an
unexpected proof that such endeavours
to express her admiration of his great
qualities, and even to soothe his afflictions,
had not been altogether unsuccessful.
The testimony of his own handwriting,
the words so judiciously chosen&mdash;even
the pains taken to fit the card to
the box&mdash;enhanced the value of the
bequest; for they proved that Napoleon
understood her motives, and that they
had occupied, for some little space of
time, the thoughts, as well as excited
the good-will, of that extraordinary
man. The whole was in good taste.
Had the gift been greater, she could not
have accepted it; had the expressions
been stronger, they would not have
appeared sincere. Surely to have afforded
satisfaction to a man so calumniated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
so persecuted, and so ill treated, and to
have excited the esteem of a mind so
capacious and so penetrating, is no slight
distinction. Lady Holland found, in the
knowledge of it, an ample reward for
her constant, unremitting, and unostentatious
compassion and generosity."</p></div>

<p>Our readers will probably agree
with us in thinking that there is
"something too much of this." It
is rather a novelty to us to be
informed that Napoleon was a persecuted
man. Most people throughout
Europe have maintained the opinion
that the persecution lay the other
way. But perhaps Lord Holland
meant to insinuate that the persecution
lay in his banishment of St
Helena. He calls it an "ungenerous
decision;" and elsewhere says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is remarkable that, in one of those
papers so sent (to Elba) by Lady Holland,
was a paragraph hinting a project
among the confederates of transporting
him to St Helena. True it is that such
an idea, however inconsistent with
honour or good faith, was started and
discussed, though probably never committed
to paper, at the Congress of
Vienna, before Napoleon left Elba. It
is just to add that it was discountenanced
and rejected by Austria. In
confirmation of so base a design having
been entertained, it is observable that
a negotiation with the East India Company
to place St Helena under the control
of the Government, with no other
probable or ostensible object for such
a measure, was actually commenced in
March 1815, and discontinued on the
landing of Napoleon in that month.
Any well-grounded suspicion of such a
proceeding was sufficient to release the
exiled Emperor from the obligations of
his treaty and abdication of Fontainebleau,
and to justify his attempt to
recover the empire he had so recently
lost."</p></div>

<p>We observe that the writer in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> denies the statement
of Lord Holland, that the
removal of Napoleon from Elba was
mooted at the Congress of Vienna.
We, on the contrary, have always
understood that the proposition was
seriously considered, though not, as
Lord Holland would insinuate, without
sufficient cause and provocation.
The intrigues, of which Elba was the
centre, to pave the way for another
attempt at the dethronement of the
Bourbons, had for some time been
in active progress, and were well
known to Fouch&eacute; and others, and by
them communicated to the Congress.
Also, the attitude of Murat in Italy
was such as to excite very serious
apprehensions. Mr Alison, in his
<i>History of Europe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> thus notices the
intrigues of Elba:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Its close proximity to the Italian
shore led naturally to a secret correspondence
between the Island of Elba and
the Court of Naples. Murat, ever
governed by ambition, and yet destitute
of the firmness of purpose requisite to
render it successful, now found that his
vacillation of conduct had ruined him with
the aristocratic, as it had formerly done
with the revolutionary party, and that the
Allies were little disposed to reward his
deviation from his engagements by the
lasting possession of the throne of Naples.
He threw himself, therefore, once more
into the arms of France; and it was
arranged that the descent of Napoleon
on the coast of Provence should be contemporaneous
with the advance of his
troops to the Po, and the proclamation
of the great principle of Italian liberty
and independence."</p></div>

<p>Accordingly, we find that Murat,
only ten days before Napoleon quitted
Elba, made a formal demand for
the passage of eighty thousand men
through the Austrian territories in
Italy&mdash;an act, doubtless, of insane
folly, but one which can be attributed
to no other motive than his perfect
knowledge that the designs of Napoleon
were nearly ripe for execution.
This demand, of course, could not fail
to alarm the Congress, to whom, almost
immediately afterwards, information
as to the character of the projected
enterprise was conveyed. Mr
Alison says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This military position and demand
excited the jealousy of the Allied Powers;
the more especially as, towards the end
of February, rumours reached Vienna of
constant correspondence between the Isle
of Elba and the adjoining shores of Italy,
and of an intended descent by Napoleon
on the shores of France. These rumours
soon acquired such consistency, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>propriety of removing him from the neighbourhood
of Italy had already been more
than once agitated in the Congress; and
various places of residence for him, in
exchange for Elba, had been proposed;&mdash;among
others, one of the Canary Islands,
which was suggested by the Portuguese
Minister, and St Helena or St Lucia,
which were proposed by Lord Castlereagh.
Alexander, however, still firmly
held out for adhering to the treaty of
Fontainebleau, and maintaining the fallen
Emperor in possession of the Island of
Elba: alleging, as a reason, that his personal
honour had been pledged to his
great antagonist for that asylum, and that
he would not be the first to break it."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></div>

<p>On the 7th of March, intelligence
reached Vienna that Napoleon had
secretly left Elba. Such we believe
to be the true statement of the case.
That the Allies should have wished,
without any adequate cause, to disturb
the recent settlement of Napoleon
in the Island of Elba, appears to
us a proposition too preposterous to
be maintained. But that such a measure
should have been discussed, <i>after</i>
they became aware of the nature of
his designs and preparations, and had
thus received warning that the peace
of Europe was again in imminent danger
from his uncontrollable ambition,
need not excite any wonder, and cannot
surely be wrested into a charge of
persecution against Napoleon. Lord
Holland entirely fails to make out&mdash;nay,
he does not even assert&mdash;that
any such proposal was made in Congress
<i>before</i> the intrigues of Elba were
divulged, or the negotiation with
Murat completed. It does not even
appear that Napoleon, previous to his
landing in France, was aware that the
Allies had received any intimation of
his design; and when we consider the
shortness of time which elapsed between
the receipt of Murat's formal
demand and the departure from Porto
Ferrajo, it is next to impossible that
any tidings of a discussion following
thereon could have reached him while
in Elba. In short, this attempt to
justify the evasion of Napoleon, and
his deliberate breach of treaty, is a
signal failure, and will certainly add
nothing to Lord Holland's posthumous
renown for historical accuracy or acumen.</p>

<p>But Lord Holland also considers
Napoleon as entitled to deep sympathy
on the ground of his being ill-treated.
That is a matter entirely of
private opinion. That Lord Bathurst
should not have purchased Lady Holland's
machine for making ice may
appear, in the eyes of the frequenters
of Holland House, a most barbarous
act of cruelty. That a special vessel
should not have been despatched for
St Helena, so often as a letter was
addressed to the illustrious captive,
may shock the sensitive mind. The
liberal soul may be thrilled with anguish
and pity at the perusal of the
following miseries inflicted on the devastator
of Europe towards the close
of his career:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It was indispensable to the peace of
the world to prevent his escape; and the
expedition from Elba had shown that no
reliance could be placed either on his
professions or his treaties. Detention
and sure custody, therefore, were unavoidable;
and every comfort consistent
with these objects was afforded him by
the British Government. He was allowed
the society of the friends who had accompanied
him in his exile; he had books in
abundance to amuse his leisure hours;
saddle-horses in profusion were at his
command; he was permitted to ride
several miles in one direction; Champagne
and Burgundy were his daily beverage;
and the bill of fare of his table,
which is shown by Las Cases as a proof
of the severity of the British Government,
would be thought the height of luxury
by most persons in a state of liberty. If
the English Government had acted towards
Napoleon as he did to others who
opposed him, they would have shot him
in the first ditch, as he did the Duc
d'Enghien or Hofer; or shut him up in an
Alpine fortress, as he did the Cardinal
Pacca."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p>But we have really dwelt too long
upon this tedious exhibition of spurious
sympathy, which, after all, is but
a flimsy veil intended to cover the
self-glorification of the peer. The
remaining passages regarding Napoleon
contain nothing of the slightest
interest, and are, moreover, especially
heavy. A few commentaries upon
various remarkable incidents in the
life of the Emperor are interspersed,
from which we learn that Lord Holland
condemned the murder of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>Duc d'Enghien, but did not consider
the abandonment of Josephine as any
heinous act of moral dereliction. We
doubt whether the majority of mankind
will concur in the latter opinion. To us
it appears that Napoleon's treatment
of his first wife shows him to have
been as destitute of heart as insensible
to the obligations of honour.</p>

<p>It is not a little amusing to observe
the estimate formed by Lord Holland
of some of his remarkable contemporaries.
Occasionally he assumes a
tranquil air of superiority, which,
when we remember the even obscurity
of his own life, in respect to the discharge
of public duties, is comical in
the extreme. Mark how he disposes
of Prince Metternich:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"That minister, originally a partisan
of the French faction, and then a tool of
Napoleon, has, no doubt, since the fall of
that great prince, supported the system
which succeeded him. He seems hardly
qualified by any superior genius to assume
the ascendency, in the councils of his own
and neighbouring nations, which common
rumour has for some years attributed to
him. He appeared to me, in the very
short intercourse I had with him, little
superior to the common run of Continental
politicians and courtiers, and clearly
inferior to the Emperor of Russia in those
qualities which secure an influence in
great affairs. Some who admit the degrading
but too prevalent opinion, that a
disregard of truth is useful and necessary
in the government of mankind, have, on
that score, maintained the contrary proposition.
His manners are reckoned
insinuating. In my slight acquaintance
with him in London, I was not struck
with them; they seemed such as might
have been expected from a German who
had studied French vivacity in the
fashionable novel of the day. I saw little
of a sagacious and observant statesman,
or of a courtier accustomed to very refined
and enlightened society."</p></div>

<p>What will the <i>cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i> of
Vienna say to this? Here is a decided
thrust at the midriff of the enemy!
Not only is Prince Metternich set
down as an exceedingly overrated
person in point of ability, but his very
manners and demeanour have been
criticised in the polite circles of Holland
House, and found wanting. We
cannot sufficiently applaud the sagacity
with which the true source of
the Metternichian polish is detected.
Truth will out at last! During the
later years of his life, the Prince has
been studying French vivacity in the
classical academies of Pigault le Brun
and Paul de Kock! And yet, perhaps,
we may be wrong. Louvet was the
earlier master, and may have had a
hand in forming the vivacity of this
distinguished pupil. But the Prince
has this consolation, at least, that he
suffers in good company. Tried by
the unerring standard of Lord Holland,
"the address of Alexander himself,
the Emperor of Russia, was,
perhaps, liable to similar criticism."
The inference is, that the Czar also
had been studying vivacity in French
novels, and was obviously not a person
accustomed to very refined and
enlightened society! As for the Emperor
Francis II., he is dismissed in a
still more summary manner:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have heard it observed, and I believe
justly, that the Emperor passed, during
his long reign, for a weak, foolish, but
good sort of man; but that he deserved
none of those epithets. He was a man of
some understanding, little feeling, and no
justice."</p></div>

<p>Perhaps the reader would take a
glimpse at the royal family of Portugal,
as seen through the critical glasses
of Lord Holland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The king and queen, very opposite in
principle, character, and conduct, have a
natural abhorrence to one another. They,
in truth, have nothing in common but a
revolting ugliness of person, and a great
awkwardness of manner. He is well-meaning,
but weak and cowardly, and so
apprehensive of being governed by his
ostensible ministers, that he becomes the
victim of low and obscure cabals, and
renders his councils at all times unsteady,
irresolute, and uncertain. The queen's
outrageous zeal in the cause of despotism,
miscalled legitimacy, is supposed to have
softened his aversion to a representative
assembly and a constitutional form of
government. The queen is vindictive,
ambitious, and selfish, and has strong propensities
to every kind of intrigue, political
or amorous."</p></div>

<p>What a sensation of awe steals
across the mind as we peruse these
wholesale sentences of condemnation!
What a sublime idea we imbibe of the
dignity and intellect of the judge!
We need not add further to this portrait
gallery, although ample materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
are afforded us. The above specimens,
we think, will be sufficient to satiate
the curiosity of the reader.</p>

<p>Lord Holland, however, had his
favourites. Napoleon, as we have
seen, was one; and Talleyrand was
another. It is rather odd that Lord
Holland should have discerned in
the latter one pre-eminent and distinguishing
quality, for which no one
else ever gave him the slightest credit&mdash;we
mean a high regard for truth.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Talleyrand," says he, "was initiated
into public affairs under M. de Calonne,
and learned from that lively minister the
happy facility of transacting business
without effort and without ceremony in
the corner of a drawing-room, or in the
recess of a window. In the exercise of
that talent, he equalled the readiness and
surpassed the wit of his model; but he
brought to his work some commodities
which the latter could never supply&mdash;viz.
<i>great veracity</i>, discretion, and foresight."</p></div>

<p>And again, in a note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My general and long observation of
Talleyrand's <span class="smcap">VERACITY</span>, in great and small
matters, makes me confident his relation
is correct. He may as much, <i>or more</i>
than other diplomatists, suppress what
is true; <i>I am quite satisfied he never actually
says what is false, though he may
occasionally imply it</i>."</p></div>

<p>It is a pity that an ordinary acquaintance
with the significance of
terms was not among the accomplishments
of Lord Holland. Here we
have the two leading elements of
falsehood&mdash;the <i>suppressio veri</i>, and the
<i>suggestio falsi</i>&mdash;plainly admitted; and
yet we are told in the same breath,
that the man who recoiled from
neither practice was a person of
great veracity! One or two hackneyed
and rather poor <i>bon-mots</i> of Talleyrand
are quoted in the text, as instances
of his remarkable wit;&mdash;had
he never enunciated anything better,
he certainly would not have achieved
his great renown as a conversationalist.
He appears, however, to have
enchanted Lord Holland, who cites his
authority on all occasions with an
implicit trustfulness which we cannot
sufficiently admire.</p>

<p>We must be allowed to remark that,
in this instance also, Lord Holland
has chosen an odd method of testifying
his respect for the memory of a
friend. In whatever liberties of
speech a famous wit may choose to
indulge with reference to his own
domestic relations, we are yet sure
that he by no means intends these to
form part of the common currency of
conversation, and that he will not
feel peculiarly obliged to any one who
gratuitously undertakes to circulate
them. The sarcasm of Talleyrand
with regard to the intellectual deficiencies
of the lady who afterwards
became his wife, was not, we presume,
intended for repetition, though
Lord Holland carefully preserves it.
Good taste, we think, would have
suggested its omission; but if our
scruples upon that point should be
thought to savour too much of Puritanism,
of this at least we are certain,
that no living relative of M. de Talleyrand
will feel indebted to Lord
Holland for the manner in which the
secret history of his marriage is related:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is generally thought that he (Talleyrand)
negotiated his return to France
through Madame de Stael. He was on
intimate terms with her, but had abandoned
her society for that of Madame
Grand before the peace of 1802, when I
saw him again at Paris. It became necessary,
on the conclusion of the <i>Concordat</i>,
that he should either revert to the habits
and character of a prelate, or receive a
dispensation from all the duties and obligations
of the order. He chose the latter.
But Buonaparte, who affected at that time
to restore great decorum in his Consular
court, somewhat maliciously insisted
either on the dismissal of Madame Grand,
or his public nuptials with that lady. The
questionable nature of her divorce from
Mr Grand created some obstacle to such
a union. It was curious to see Sir Elijah
Impey, the judge who had granted her
husband damages in India for her infidelity,
caressed at her little court at
Neuilly. His testimony was deemed
essential, and he was not disposed to
withhold it, because, notwithstanding his
denial of riches in the House of Commons,
he was at that very time urging a claim
on the French Government to indemnify
him for his losses in their funds. Mr (Sir
Philip) Francis, her paramour, then at
Paris also, did not fail to draw the attention
of Englishmen to the circumstance,
though he was not himself admitted at
Neuilly to complete the curious group
with his judicial enemy and quondam
mistress."</p></div>

<p>Pleasant reading this! It may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
said that the facts were long ago notorious,
and that they are to be found
in more than one scandalous chronicle.
That may possibly be the case; but
surely it can afford no apology for this
elaborate repetition on the part of a
friend. Is history served by such
contributions? Does society benefit
by their preservation?</p>

<p>The passion of the past generation
for collecting and retailing <i>bon-mots</i>
was carried to an extravagant length.
Such a man as Talleyrand was a perfect
treasure to any coterie, for his
established reputation gave to every
sentence which he uttered more than
its intrinsic value. But we often find
that sayings which appear most brilliant
in conversation, lose their lustre
when committed to writing, after the
occasion which called them forth has
passed away. Therefore we do not
attach any very exorbitant value to
their collection, especially when they
are flavoured, as it is too often the
case, with coarseness and personality.
The writer in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
expresses a wish "that Lord Holland,
who possessed more opportunities
than any other man for collecting
and stringing these conversational
pearls, had been more diligent in so
agreeable a vocation." Judging from
the specimens which are given, we do
not think that the world has sustained
any great loss from the negligence
of the noble peer; for some of those
which have escaped oblivion, bear
unmistakable symptoms of the decomposition
of the heap from which they
were originally culled.</p>

<p>In short, we feel ourselves compelled
to say that we cannot consider
this volume as an important or even
creditable contribution to the historical
literature of the country. Those
portions of it which do not directly
offend, are so uninteresting and destitute
of the charms of style, that they
act as a positive soporific; and, but
for the indignation excited by the
more objectionable passages, we doubt
very much whether we could have
had patience enough to peruse it from
the title-page to the close. We are
not sure whether we even understand
the meaning of several sentences, or
whether they really were intended to
convey any meaning at all. Possibly
the fault lies with us. We may be
either too dull, or too unversed in
the occult innuendos of diplomatic
society, to perceive what is clear
and perspicuous to those who have
enjoyed superior advantages. Nevertheless,
we would give a trifle to
any one who should enlighten us upon
the point of relationship suggested
by the following paragraph. Lord
Holland is recounting a conversation
held in 1838 with his friend Godoy,
the Prince of the Peace, in the course
of which they appear to have discussed
family matters with that
charming ease which excludes considerations
of propriety.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I asked him if he saw Don Francisco;
and his manner of saying 'no' convinced
me that that Prince, who is notoriously
his son, had made no advances to him;
for he somewhat earnestly explained that
it did not become him to seek his protection,
and enlarged on the opportunities he
had of knowing the Infanta before her
marriage at Rome, and talking of the
beauty of her mother, Isabella, Queen of
Naples, <i>who was in all senses, I believe,
the own brother of her son-in-law Francisco</i>."</p></div>

<p>We have certainly no overstrained
impression of the moral purity of the
European courts as they existed fifty
years ago. We have no doubt of the
existence of intrigues of a very shameful
nature, and even less of a widespread
system of venality and corruption;
but we totally demur to the
opinion which Lord Holland seems to
have entertained, that such topics
constitute the most interesting and
most important points of history. A
man who is collecting notes relative
to the leading features of the age in
which he has lived, with the deliberate
intention that these shall, at
some future period, be given to the
public, might surely be better occupied&mdash;more
creditably to himself, and
more usefully to his species&mdash;in directing
his attention to the great
subjects of social progress, intellectual
development, and high unselfish
patriotism, than in gleaning
at second-hand the malicious reports
of the antechamber, or in chronicling
the whispers of the waiting-room.
Lord Holland either would
not, or could not, avail himself of the
opportunities which were evidently
within his reach. He has preferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
giving us some sketches, not conceived
in the best or most delicate
taste, to the composition of a manly
picture; and therefore we cannot be
expected to feel any exuberant degree
of gratitude on the receipt of
the legacy, or to entertain any very
exalted notion of the artistical acquirements
of the painter.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be thought that we
have attached more importance to
this work than it deserves; and certainly,
seeing that we have been compelled
to pronounce so unfavourable
a judgment on its merits, there may
appear room for the allegation. But
it must be remembered that a book
always acquires a certain degree of
factitious importance from the position
of its writer. Humble and
nameless men may scribble their Reminiscences
by the ream, rush boldly
into print, and yet find scarce a single
reader. If their works are indeed destitute
of merit, they can hardly be said
to fall into oblivion, for they never take
hold of the memory. They have
neither the advantage of a name
to introduce, nor the greater advantage
of genius to recommend them.
But the case is different when
men of station and title come forward
in the character of authors.
They are sure to find an audience,
even though that audience should
be deeply disappointed; and if,
besides these other advantages,
they are fortunate enough to have
any sort of literary connection, they
never want heralds who are ready and
able to proclaim their advent to the
world. We regret exceedingly that
we have been compelled to use the
language of condemnation rather than
of praise&mdash;for the literature of the present
century has been greatly enriched
in almost every department by the
contributions of the nobility of England,
and we never feel greater pleasure
than when able to bear testimony to
such instances of talent and industry.
It becomes, therefore, of more
importance that the critical function
should be duly and justly performed;
and that no work, which does not
possess a certain degree of intrinsic
merit, should be allowed to pass
under shelter of the author's name.
Had the merit been there, we should
most gladly have followed the example
of our critical brother in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>; and, adopting his
magnificent, sonorous, but not very
intelligible phraseology, have taken
care that "the last chords of our
opera should be accompanied by
double drums, and the burst of a
brass band, and that our curtain
should drop before the gold and tissue,
the waving wings, and the flowing
garlands of a modern opera!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>POPERY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</h2>


<p>The constant custom of the advocates
of Popery is to represent their
religion as a work of the primitive
age. With them it is a Patriarchal
figure, beginning its pilgrimage by a
Divine summons, and protected by
Divine influence; perhaps occasionally
touched by the stains, or sinking
under the struggles belonging to all
human history, but still suddenly
purifying its robes into more than
their original brightness, and turning
its difficulties into the weapons of
that warfare which is to end in the
sovereignty of the world.</p>

<p>The learned investigation of Protestantism,
however, wholly strips
this Patriarchal figure of its antique
habiliments, declares that every fragment
of its ceremonial has been the
work of ages when Christianity had
fallen into oblivion; that its belief is
credulity, its system an accumulation
of error, and its spirit an antagonism
to the gospel.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Popish
stigma on Protestantism is, that it is
a <i>new</i> name, unknown before the
sixteenth century. But to this
charge the natural answer has been,
that a name is nothing; that Christianity
was once a new name, and that
Heathenism was older than Popery.</p>

<p>The true question is of principle,
and then the decision is clear. Popery
appeals for its authority to councils
and fathers; Protestantism, to apostles
and prophets. The doctrines of Rome
are to be looked for only in the annals
of the Popedom; the doctrines of
Protestantism appeal only to the
New Testament. "The Bible, and
the Bible alone, is the religion of
Protestants," was the maxim of the
celebrated Chillingworth. Nothing
commanded by the New Testament
can be rejected by Protestantism, nothing
contradictory of the New Testament
can be received by Protestantism.
The appeal of Rome is to tradition;
the appeal of Protestantism is to inspiration.</p>

<p>We shall now give the dates, at
which the peculiar errors of Popery
were engrafted on the worship of the
Roman world.</p>

<p>The claim of the Headship of Christianity
was the first of the Romish
errors, and the fount from which they
all flowed. But this claim was first
formally made in the sixth century,
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, 533,) and was established by the
Emperor Justinian. But no mortal
power had the right to give, or to
assume, this title. The headship of
the universal church belongs to Christ
alone, who has been made "Head over
all things to His church." No human
being could be competent to the high
duty of governing a church spreading,
and to be ultimately spread, through
all nations. The government is also
<i>spiritual</i>, of which no human being of
this earth can have a <i>comprehension</i>.
Its seizure by the Bishop of Rome
was an enormous usurpation. In
about sixty years after, the title was
disclaimed by the Bishop of Rome, in
indignation at its seizure by the
Bishop of Constantinople; but it was
solicited again, in the reign of the
Emperor Phocas, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, 606,) and has
been ever since retained.</p>

<p>It is not to be presumed, that this
usurpation was universally allowed.
God has not left Himself without
witnesses in any age. Successive
opponents of Rome, preachers of the
gospel, the true Protestants, arose
during the dark ages; and a continued
resistance to superstition was sustained
for the thousand years of the
Popish assumption; until, in the sixteenth
century, the recovery of learning,
the renewed intelligence of the
human mind, the translation of the
Bible, and, above all, and acting
through all, the mercy of God, restored
Christianity to the world in the
glorious German Reformation, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1517.)</p>

<p>The most visible practice of Popery
is Mass-worship. This practice commenced
early; but we have no direct
record of its reception until the
<i>Second</i> Council of <span class="smcap">Nice</span>, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 787.)</p>

<p>Infallibility was too monstrous a
conception to be adopted, but in the
utter prostration of the general mind.
It was, accordingly, first made an
article of faith in the very centre of
the Dark Ages, (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1076.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>But this claim is so repugnant to
reason, so contradictory to the common
sense of man, and so palpably
overthrown by the vicious conduct of
Popes, and the contemptible quarrels
of Councils, that, even among the
Papists, it has been the most dubious
of all doctrines&mdash;some of the Popish
parties placing infallibility in a General
Council, some in a General Council
united with the Pope, some in the
Universal Church. But those disputes,
which no human understanding could
ever decide, show only the repugnancy
of the doctrine itself to the human
intellect. Infallibility was, at length,
by the mere ignorance of knowing
where to place it, quietly delivered
into the possession of the Pope. He
now presumed to be the <i>acting</i>
infallibility of the Romish world.</p>

<p>Yet, immeasurably absurd as this
doctrine is, it is the especial and favourite
one on which the Tractarians
insist, and by which the apostates
attempt to justify their guilty desertion
to Rome. Infatuated as they are,
they have fixed on the very point
where infatuation is most infatuated,
where perversion most degrades
the character of the understanding.</p>

<p>The Celibacy of the Clergy.&mdash;After
several attempts by ambitious Popes,
this doctrine, or ordinance, was established
by the tyrannical Hildebrand,
Gregory the Seventh, in the eleventh
century. The parochial clergy had
generally married, and they protested
long and strongly against abandoning
their wives. But the advantage of
having the ecclesiastics, in all countries,
wholly separated from all connexion
with their native soil and native interests,
and the fixture of large bodies
of men in every kingdom, wholly
devoted to the objects of the Popedom,
overpowered the voice alike of nature,
justice, and scripture. "Those whom
God had joined together" <i>were</i> put
asunder by man.</p>

<p>No act, even of the Papacy, ever
produced more suffering or more crime.
No act could be politically more injurious,
for it withdrew from the increase
of the population&mdash;in times when
population was the great want of
Europe, and when half the land was
desert&mdash;300,000 parochial priests,
300,000 monks and friars, and probably
upwards of 300,000 nuns; thus
giving to a life of idleness, and almost
total uselessness in a national
view, an enormous multitude of human
beings annually, down to this hour,
through nearly nine centuries!</p>

<p>But, to give the true character of
this presumptuous contempt of the
Divine will, and of the primal blessing
of "Increase and multiply, and replenish
the earth," and of the universal
custom of the Jewish covenant, in
which the priesthood descended by
families; we should know the solitary
miseries entailed by monastic and
conventual life, the thousands of
hearts broken by remorse for those
rash bonds, the thousands sunk into
idiotism and frenzy by the monotony,
the toilsome trifling, the useless severities,
and the habitual tyrannies
of the cloister. Even to those we
must add the still darker page of that
grossness of vice which, in the ages
previous to the Reformation, produced
frequent remonstrances even from the
Popes, and perpetual disgust among
the people.</p>

<p>The Invocation of Saints.&mdash;This
doctrine first assumed an acknowledged
form in the seventh century.
It had been gradually making its way,
since the dangerous homage paid to the
tombs of the martyrs in the third and
fourth centuries. But this invocation
made them, in the estimate of their
worshippers, gods. For the supposition
that they heard and answered
prayer in every part of the world at
once, necessarily implied Omnipresence&mdash;an
attribute exclusively
belonging to Deity.</p>

<p>Transubstantiation.&mdash;This doctrine
declares that, when the words of consecration
have been pronounced over
the Eucharist, the bread and wine are
<i>actually</i> transformed into the <i>body
and blood</i>, the <i>soul and divinity</i> of
Christ. This monstrous notion was
wholly unknown to the Christians of
the first four centuries. In the
eleventh century, it was held that the
body of Christ was actually present,
without directly affirming in what
manner. It was not until the thirteenth
century (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1215) that the
change of the bread and wine became
an acknowledged doctrine, by the
Fourth Lateran Council.</p>

<p>This doctrine contradicts the conception
of a miracle, which consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
in a <i>visible</i> supernatural change. It
contradicts the physical conception of
body, which is, that body is local, and
of course cannot be in two places at
once; but the body of Christ is in
Heaven. It also contradicts Scripture,
which pronounces that the taking
of the bread and wine would be
wholly profitless, but by the accompanying
operation of the Holy Spirit
acting on the faithful partaker of the
Sacrament; the language of Christ
being&mdash;"The <i>flesh</i> profiteth nothing.
The words that I speak to you, they
are spirit." The whole efficacy is
spiritual.</p>

<p>The Mass.&mdash;Popery declares that in
the Mass is offered continually the
<i>actual sacrifice</i> of Christ. This conception
arises from Transubstantiation,
by which the Host is Christ;
and the priest thus continually offering
the Host is presumed to sacrifice
our Lord, in every instance of the
offering!</p>

<p>This doctrine is threefold&mdash;that the
priest can make God, that flour and
water can be God, and that the wafer,
which is still but flour and water to
the senses, is the Christ of whom it
is declared in Scripture that, "having
suffered <i>once for all</i> for the sins of
men, he sat down for ever at the
right hand of God." This monstrous
doctrine was long disputed, and,
though practically adopted, was not
confirmed before the Council of Trent,
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1563.)</p>

<p>The Half-communion.&mdash;This doctrine
originated also in Transubstantiation.
From pronouncing the
Eucharist to be actually Christ,
scruples arose as to its chances of
pollution; and as the wine might be
spilt, it became the custom to give
only the bread to the laity, in whose
mouths it is placed by the priest.
But a mutilated sacrament is none.
The consequence of this doctrine is,
that no Popish <i>layman</i> ever receives
the Eucharist, or has received it
during the last four hundred years!&mdash;most
awful and terrible result of
human presumption!</p>

<p>Auricular Confession.&mdash;By this
doctrine, the forgiveness of sin must
be preceded by confession to a priest.
In contradiction to the whole tenor of
Scripture, which declares the forgiveness
of sin to depend on sincere
prayer for forgiveness, through the
atonement of Christ, and on the determination
to sin no more: "Come
to <i>me</i> all ye that are heavy laden, and
I will refresh you."&mdash;"Repent ye, and
be converted, that your sins may be
blotted out."</p>

<p>But Auricular Confession, with its
subsequent Absolution, actually increases
crime, by disburthening the
mind of remorse, and by substituting
absolution for repentance. This practice
was established, as a portion of
the acknowledged system of Rome,
scarcely before the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Purgatory.&mdash;This doctrine was unheard
of in the first four centuries.
It crept in about the seventh century,
the period of the chief corruptions of
worship. It was not sanctioned by
any council until the fifteenth century,
(<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1438.) Its first establishment
was by the Council of Trent.</p>

<p>This doctrine, which is wholly contradictory
to the redemption declared
in the Gospel, as resulting from the
sufferings of Christ alone; declares
that every sinner must be qualified
for redemption in part, by undergoing
sufferings of his own; that he must
be personally punished in Purgatory
for his temporal sins, to be purified
for Heaven. The doctrine is evidently
borrowed from the Heathen
ideas of Tartarus. It has not the
slightest ground in Scripture, and is
totally opposed to the whole spirit
and bearing of Christianity.</p>

<p>Indulgences.&mdash;This doctrine originated
in the combination of Purgatory
and Saintship. It held, that the
merits of the dead might be applied
to the wants of the living; and that
these merits, not being required for
the redemption of the saints, were
preserved in the hands of the Church,
to be distributed as remissions from
Penance, in the first instance, and in
the next, from the terms of suffering
in Purgatory. These remissions were
sold by Rome under the name of
Indulgences, and were given for any
and every period. These Indulgences
extended from a year to ten thousand
years. Instances are recorded of
their being extended to thirty thousand
years! This was the most
lucrative portion of the traffic of
Rome. It brought in prodigious
sums to the Roman Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>Masses for the Dead.&mdash;This doctrine
was connected with those of Purgatory
and Indulgences. By it a succession
of solitary masses might be continually
carried on, either to relieve the
Purgatorial torments, or shorten their
duration. But these masses must be
paid for either in money or land. They
formed the vast funds which endowed
the great Romish establishments&mdash;the
monasteries, &amp;c. Operating on
the fears of the dying, the Popish
priesthood rapidly possessed themselves
of enormous wealth, and, in
England, they were calculated to be
masters of one-third of the land! The
statute of mortmain alone preserved
the rest. This prodigious grasp was
loosened at the Reformation, and the
monkish institutions were deprived of
the wealth gained only by superstition.</p>

<p>It is obvious how fatally a doctrine
of this order must operate on society.
If man could clear himself from the
punishment of a life of profligacy by
a bequest on his deathbed, his whole
responsibility would be removed at
once. The fear of judgment would be
extinguished throughout his life; he
could have no restraint but the arm
of society. Masses would be his
substitute for morals; and his conscience
would be cleared by the acts
of others, for years after he was
laid in the grave. If Masses could
avail, there would be no use in living
virtue, to any man who was able to
<i>pay for them</i>.</p>

<p>This doctrine, intolerable in the
view of common sense, unjust in
placing an insurmountable distinction
between the rich and the poor, and
wholly contradictory to the spirit of
the gospel&mdash;which commands that
"every man shall work out his <i>own
salvation</i> with fear and trembling, for
it is God that worketh in him, <i>both to
will and to do</i>"&mdash;was created and
continued for its vast profits to the
priesthood of Rome.</p>

<p>The celebrated Council of Trent,
which, under various forms, sat from
1542 till 1563, collected all these
doctrines into a <i>system</i>, and the subsequent
act of Pius IV. gave them in
the shape of a creed to the Popish
world.</p>

<p>We are glad to find that the "Papal
Aggression" has awakened the intelligent
and important authority of
the English bar. On all great questions
of the liberties and rights of the
empire, that authority is of the most
decisive order; and in this spirit we
welcome with peculiar gratification a
pamphlet from the well-known and
eloquent pen of Mr Warren.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> He
commences by this bold and manly
denunciation of the Papal interference
with the rights of the Church and the
privileges of the crown:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The ascendency of the Protestant
faith in this country is in danger, notwithstanding
the noble movement which
has been made in its defence. The
position so suddenly taken by the mortal
enemy of that faith, is meant to be permanent;
and he is silently intrenching
himself in it: regarding all that has
been said by this great nation as
"sound and fury, signifying&mdash;<span class="smcap">NOTHING</span>."
He is infinitely more to be feared than
he wishes at present to be believed;
and though the precipitancy of priestly
ambition may have deranged, for a
moment, the working of his policy, it is
really profound and comprehensive, as
its results will in due time show; and
has been accommodated to the political
and ecclesiastical circumstances of the
country with malignant exactitude and
skilfulness.</p>

<p>"The political power of the Papacy lies
hid under its spiritual pretensions, like
a venomous serpent lurking under lovely
foliage and flowers. A leading object of
this Letter, is to explain and illustrate
that truth, in its practical application to
the great question now before the
country, challenging its best energies of
thought and will. It would be fatally
fallacious to regard the late act of the
Pope as exhibiting only the spasms of
weakness. The more it is considered,
the greater cause will be developed for
anxious but resolute action. As a pretender
to the exercise of direct temporal
power, the Pope seems quite impotent;
but he is the visible exponent of a
spiritual despotism, founded (so we
Protestants believe, or have no right to
be such) as clearly on falsehood and
impiety, as its pretensions and purpose
are at once sublime and execrable; that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>purpose being to extinguish, and in the
name of Heaven, the liberties of mankind.</p>

<p>"The question then&mdash;'<i>The Queen or
the Pope?</i>'&mdash;is a momentous one, which
we have been very insolently challenged
to answer. The whole matter, social,
political, and religious, is gathered up
into those few words; and posterity
will sit in judgment on our mode of
answering that question."</p></div>

<p>Mr Warren, in taking a lawyer's
general view of the subject, strikingly
adverts to the <i>impudence</i> of the
Papist assertions. It is true that
these assertions have now shrunk
into a very small compass; that the
bravado of "my Lord Cardinal" has
dwindled down into a sort of supplication
to be suffered to remain here
on any terms; and that the "prince"
has stooped into the pilgrim, gliding
through the filth, vice, and poverty
of the Irish colony in Westminster,
or, as he terms it, the <i>slums</i>&mdash;an
expression of extreme vulgarity,
which, Mr Warren justly observes,
does not belong to the English language,
and which, we may as justly
observe, belongs only to the meanest
of the rabble.</p>

<p>But the organs of Popery abroad
have not submitted to circumstances
so demurely, and they let out the
Popish objects with all the easy insolence
of the foreigner. Thus Count
le Maistre, in a work translated and
published in London, says, "What
shall we say of Protestantism, and
of those who defend it, <i>when it will
no longer exist</i>? Let them rather aid
us in making it disappear. In order
to re-establish a religion and a
morality in Europe, in order to give
to truth the strength which it requires
for the <i>conquest it meditates</i>, it is an
indispensable preliminary to <i>efface</i>
from the European dictionary that
fatal word, <i>Protestantism</i>." <i>L'Univers</i>,
the journal of Popery in France, has
no hesitation in pronouncing the
Protestant faith in England to be
totally undone, and that Popery is
only taking its time to make the
operation complete.</p>

<p>The Popish organ here has been
equally plain-spoken, and pronounced,
in the most dashing style, the triumph
of Rome, and the return of <i>all Protestants</i>
under its yoke, <i>on pain of
damnation</i>! Who but must be indignant
at this language! But who
can henceforth be deceived?</p>

<p>Mr Warren, in reverting to the
character and pretensions of the
Papacy, lays it down as a fundamental
proposition, that "the Pope's
avowed spiritual power is pregnant
with disavowed political power." He,
tells us further, "that we have to
tolerate a rival, who condescends to
equality only as an advance to ascendency."
He then gives the memorable
Florentine canon of 1439, which
the Romish lawyers regard as containing
"the true doctrine of their
church," and for the consequences
deducible from which all Papists are
answerable. These are its words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Moreover, we define that the
Holy Apostolic See, and the Roman
Pontiff, have a primacy <i>over the
whole world</i>!&mdash;and that the Roman
Pontiff is the successor of St Peter,
the chief of the apostles, and true
Vicar of Christ!&mdash;and that he is
'head of the whole church,' and the
father and teacher of all Christians!&mdash;and
to him, in St Peter, was delegated
by our Lord Jesus Christ full
power to <i>feed, rule, and govern</i> the
universal church, as also is contained
in the Acts of General Councils, and
in the holy canons!" In this daring
proclamation of power, we have the
assumption of an authority obviously
incompatible with the peace of any
nation under heaven, and equally
incompatible with the common liberties
of mankind&mdash;for there can be no
liberty where the arbitrary will of a
stranger is the fountain of the law,
and most especially contradictory to
that Scripture which declares that
Christ's kingdom is <i>not</i> a kingdom
after the fashion of this world.
When the question was contemptuously
put by Pilate to our Lord
himself, "Art <i>thou</i> a king?" the
answer was, that he was not a king
in the sense of the Roman; that, if he
were such, "his servants would fight"&mdash;in
other words, that he would have
the troops and attendance of an
earthly king, that he would have
resisted and made war. "But now
is my kingdom <i>not</i> of this world."</p>

<p>But what is the Papacy, with its
princes and pageantries, its armies
and intrigues, its cabinets and alliances?
In what does all this com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>plicated
and systematic mixture in
the affairs of the world differ from the
kingdoms of this world? except perhaps
in its deeper intrigue, in its
more perpetual artifice, in its more
insatiable craving for power, and in
its more habitual gratification of
every daring and dangerous passion
of man.</p>

<p>And it has felt the consequences.
Of all the kingdoms of this world,
since the fall of Rome, the Popedom
has been the <i>most</i> marked by calamity.
There has been no nation whose
sovereign has been so <i>often</i> flung from
his throne; whose throne has been so
often contested with bloody dissension,
whose sovereign has been so
often a prisoner in foreign lands,
whose capital has been so often
sacked, whose provinces have been
so often in foreign possession, whose
population is so miserable, and whose
<i>vassalage</i> has been so palpable, so
humiliating, and so wretched.</p>

<p>But need we look to the past,
when we see the Papacy at this hour?
Need we dig up ancient fields of battle,
to see how often its armies have been
buried; or dive into its dungeons, to
see how many centuries of fetters are
recorded there against its presumption?
Need we break up its tombs
to see its shattered crosiers and
tarnished tiaras, when we see the
living figure that sits in mock majesty
in the Vatican, with a <i>French</i> garrison
in the Castle of St Angelo?</p>

<p>But the Papist demands religious
liberty. The words, in Papist lips, are
jargon. He has never had it in any
country on earth. Has he it in
Rome? Can the man have the
absurdity to call himself a freeman,
when the priest may tear the Bible
out of his hand; when, without a
license, he cannot look into the Book
of Life?&mdash;when, with or without a
license, he cannot exercise his own
understanding upon its sacred truths,
but must refuse even to think, except
as the priest commands?&mdash;when, for
daring to have an opinion on the
most essential of all things&mdash;his own
salvation&mdash;he is branded as a heretic;
and when, for uttering that opinion,
he is cast into the dungeon?&mdash;when
the priest, with the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i>
in his hand, may walk into his
house, and strip it of every book displeasing
to the caprices, insolence, and
ignorance of a <i>coterie</i> of monks in the
Vatican?</p>

<p>If the legitimate and noble boast of
the Englishman is, that his house is
his castle, what is the house of the
Italian Papist, but his dungeon? If
the Irish or the English Papist demands
"Religious Liberty," let him
demand it of his master the Pope. If
the Papist <i>desires</i> it, let him break the
Popish fetter, and emancipate himself.
Till then, we must look upon his claim
as lawlessness instead of liberty, and
hypocrisy instead of religion.</p>

<p>But, before the Papist requires more
than toleration, must he not show
that at least he <i>tolerates</i>? If, in the
Popish kingdoms of the Continent,
fear or policy has produced some
degree of Protestant toleration, what
is the condition of Protestantism in
the capital of Popery; and, in its
most important point, freedom of
worship? To this day, no English
Protestant is suffered to worship
within the walls of Rome.</p>

<p>The Americans, with a sense of
national right, of which it is a scandal
to England not to have adopted the
example, have insisted on having a
chapel&mdash;a solitary chapel!&mdash;in Rome;
while the English have been forced
to run from one <i>lodging</i> to another,
to hide in holes and corners, and to
exhibit to the Roman rabble the sight
of Protestants sneaking to a worship
indebted only to connivance for its
being suffered to exist at all! From
1815, the year in which <i>we</i> gave liberty
to the Pope, their worship was held
only in <i>private rooms</i> for the ten following
years, even to which the
English were prohibited from going in
carriages. They must go on foot!
From 1826, the condition of their
worship is thus stated on the authority
of the chaplain:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In that year, the English congregation
migrated to a <i>granary</i> outside
the Flaminian Gate. In the upper part
of this huge building, a space, large
enough for a congregation, was hired.
It was reduced into shape by lath and
plaster; it had a ceiling of canvass to
hide the rafters and cobwebs, and
carpets laid over straw, for covering
the mud floor. The rats and mice ran
races over the canvass above the heads
of the worshippers; the pigs, in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
numbers, squealed in concert in the
story below; and sometimes the donkeys,
laden with sacks of corn, disputed
the common staircase with the
congregation. On one occasion, the
competition was more serious. The
first story of the building was hired
for a <i>menagerie</i>, and on a Sunday
morning we found the wild beasts in
previous possession."</p>

<p>Can any vulgar display of intolerance
exceed this humiliation?
There is not a beggar in Rome who
does not stand on tiptoe, at the
sight of the English going to their
<i>barn</i>. There is not a saucy priest,
who does not turn up his nostrils
at the sight. And yet the population
live on the English expenditure.
If the English were to leave Rome
for a twelvemonth, half their population&mdash;a
population of lodging-letters
and valets&mdash;would starve. We
certainly can feel no compassion
for any degree of contempt which
can be heaped on the English residents,
who desert their own noble
country for the coffee-house life of the
Continent. The men who can abandon
their duties to England (and what
man is not without his duty?) for cheap
wine, gossip, and grimace&mdash;the race of
sullen selfishness and perpetual vacuity&mdash;are
justly punished by foreign
ill-usage. But still, the insult
is to the religion of England, and it
teaches us the real feeling of Popery
in power. Let the Protestant ever
suffer the predominance of Rome in
England, and he will then only know
what Popish power is in its nature,
its fierce recollections, and its grasping
ambition. In the mean time, let him
look at the Protestants creeping
through the "Flaminian Gate" to their
<i>Barn</i>, outside the walls of Rome!</p>

<p>What right can those have, who so
loudly proclaim themselves the spiritual
subjects of the Papacy, to demand
here what they refuse there?
Are they to insist on privileges, where
their condescension only amounts to
pigsties? What would become of their
levees and lectures here, if we laid
them under the Roman rule, which
sends "controversialists to jail?" Is
it not the fact, that no Protestant can
be buried within the walls of Rome;
and that no inscription can be placed
on a Protestant grave, without being
subjected to the Roman Censor; who
scratches his pen over every syllable
referring to the hope of a <i>Resurrection</i>?</p>

<p>Those statements have been repeated
in every public journal of the
empire. Who has contradicted them?
Have we not, then, a right to demand
the liberty which we give? or, if refused
by the dwarfed and beggarly
sovereignty of Rome, ought we not
to act with the insulted dignity of
the first kingdom and truest religion
of the world?</p>

<p>The great error of Protestants, in
their legislation on Popish questions,
is, to believe that the same rules of
morality exist in the Church of England
and in Popery. The pamphlet
applies itself with full effect to the
facts of the case, by giving the Papist
<i>oath</i>, and contrasting it with the
Papist performance.</p>

<p>"The essential items of the Papist
oath of 1829 were&mdash;'I do not believe
that the Pope of Rome hath, or ought
to have, any temporal or civil jurisdiction,
power, superiority, or pre-eminence,
directly or indirectly, within
this realm. I disclaim, disavow, and
solemnly abjure <i>any intention to subvert
the present Church Establishment</i>,
as settled by law within this realm;
and I solemnly swear, that <i>I never
will exercise any privilege</i>, to which I
am or may be entitled, to <i>disturb</i> or
<i>weaken</i> the Protestant religion or
Protestant government in the United
Kingdom.'"</p>

<p>What must be the contempt felt for
all Popish promises, when we see this
<i>oath</i>, and see the conduct of the Popish
body <i>ever since</i> it was taken!
"With what feelings," says Mr
Warren, "any one who has taken
this oath, can peruse and approve of
the Bull of Pius IX. and the Pastoral
of his pseudo-cardinal archbishop, and
contemplate with satisfaction what
has been recently done by him and
others in professed conformity with
that Bull, I am perfectly at a loss to
conceive."</p>

<p>And in this honest difficulty of conception
every true Protestant will
coincide with him. But let us look
to the natural result of this palpable
callousness of conscience.</p>

<p>The sacredness of oaths is essential
to the <i>existence</i> of society: the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
who is not to be believed on his oath
is self-banished, self-disfranchised,
self-excluded from all the rights of
society; for the obvious reason, that,
if all men were equally false, society
<i>must</i> dissolve. Such a man is no
longer entitled to the protection of
law. And the same rule is inevitably
applicable to any institution which
thus sets itself at war with society.
Popery is <i>anti-social</i>. This sentiment
is the substance of a letter by the late
Bishop Watson; a man of a rough
and almost republican spirit&mdash;a bold
advocate for liberality, almost to the
verge of Liberalism&mdash;and, though a
vigorous arguer against Paine and his
infidelity, yet as sturdy a disclaimer
of all submission to prejudice as any
radical orator of our day. We quote
the pamphlet.</p>

<p>In a letter to the Duke of Rutland,
in 1784, the Bishop says&mdash;"I
particularly agree with you in relation
to the (Roman) Catholics. No man
on earth, I trust, can have more enlarged
sentiments of toleration than I
have. But the Church of Rome is a
<i>persecuting</i> Church; and it is our
interest and <i>our duty</i>, on every principle
of <i>religion and common sense</i>, to
guard ourselves against her machinations."
He then gives the expression
of the great Lord Clarendon&mdash;"It is
the <i>duty</i> of Catholic subjects in a
Protestant country, of priests as well
as the laity, to abjure the Pope's
supremacy, <i>ecclesiastical</i> as well as
temporal."</p>

<p>The Popish advocates lay great
weight on the patronage afforded to
their parliamentary demands by the
Cabinet of Pitt; who evidently made
the grand mistake of supposing that
spiritual dominion could be disunited
from temporal&mdash;a mistake as great as
supposing that the command of the
limbs could be disunited from the
power of the mind. But the views of
the Minister were founded merely on
political objects, while the true question
was one of religion. The argument
is thus summarily answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me remind you that an illustrious
statesman, William Pitt, in the
very last speech which he delivered
in Parliament, expressed himself on
the subject of Roman Catholic emancipation
in the following remarkable
language:&mdash;'I never thought that it
would have been wise to throw down
rudely the guards and fences of the
Constitution. But I did think, that
if the system I alluded to had been
adopted, it <i>ought</i> to have been accompanied
by those checks and guards,
and with every regulation which
could have given respect and influence
to the Established Church, to
the support and protection of the
Protestant interest, and to the encouragement
of every measure which
could tend to propagate the example
of the <i>Protestant religion</i>.'</p>

<p>"His splendid pupil, Canning, the
most ardent friend of Roman Catholic
emancipation, also thus expressed
himself: 'Go as far as you can,
<i>with safety</i> to the Establishment.
Do not exact from them terms that
are unnecessary, but be rigorous in
imposing such conditions as shall free
you from all real, I had almost said
all imaginary, danger.'"</p>

<p>These are important opinions,
which should teach us <i>how</i> to act.
We have seen those guards and fences
broken down; we have seen every
protective condition <i>accepted</i>, and
finally scoffed at, and we are at this
moment at once insulted and injured
by the cool and contemptuous violation
of every promise which was
required for the safety of the Church&mdash;of
Protestantism.</p>

<p>But the whole system of concession
was founded on ignorance, carried on
by faction, and suffered by infatuation.
That unhappy concession is
the only blot on the tomb of Pitt,
who made it in ignorance: it is the
chief among the many blots on the
tomb of Canning, who made faction
his auxiliary, by first sacrificing his
Toryism; and it covers with the
indelible contempt, due to the traffic
of principle, the whole paltry and
perfidious generation who, subsequently,
under different garbs, but
with the same physiognomy of worldliness,
have droned and drivelled and
died off in the shadow of the Treasury.
What the majority of those men
thought, is a subject too low for
memory; what they did, is to be
seen in the scars of the Constitution.</p>

<p>But when the mighty orb of Pitt
undergoes an eclipse, it must be by a
body of no slight magnitude. His
wisdom was actually thwarted by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
magnanimity. Himself the soul of
honour, he evidently imagined that
Popery was capable of honour.</p>

<p>"What would William Pitt, what
would George Canning, say?" exclaims
Mr Warren, "were they still
alive to read the Bull of Pius IX. and
Dr Wiseman's Pastoral? and <i>what
would they do</i>?"</p>

<p>We think that we can answer the
question. If Pitt denounced the
grasping ambition of French republicanism,
if Canning lashed the low
absurdities of Radicalism, with what
indignant justice would they not have
stript and scourged an aggression
which unites more than the ambition
of the one, with more than the absurdity
of the other! With what lofty
vengeance would Pitt have trampled
down the haughty usurpation which
dared to degrade England into a
<i>province</i>! and with what sarcastic
ridicule would Canning have stung
the bloated arrogance with which,
from a palace almost a <i>prison</i>, an impudent
monk dared to control the
liberties of England!</p>

<p>But what would the Papal assumptions
be, if uttered by any other
sovereign? Let us suppose that
Austria ventured to send a dozen of
her monks here to carve the land into
dioceses. What would be the universal
exclamation, but that Austria
was <i>mad</i>; and that the first monk who
made the attempt should find his only
diocese within the walls of Newgate.
What if France declared England a
<i>province</i>? Can we doubt that our
answer would be a declaration of war?
And is a beggarly Italian&mdash;a fugitive
from his own territory, a priest flying
for his life in the livery of a footman&mdash;to
offer this insult with impunity?
But if we are told that Pius IX. is a
different personage from his predecessors,
a <i>Liberal</i>, a man of the new
school&mdash;tempted, by misrepresentations
from his emissary monks here,
to make a usurpation against his
nature&mdash;let us hear the pamphlet:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us go to the fountain-head.
Pope Pius IX., who, on his elevation
to the supreme Episcopate, addressed
an elaborate Encyclical Letter to 'all
patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and
bishops,' dated 9th of November
1846, and which, to the eyes of any
person in whom exists a single spark
of true protestant Christianity, appears
surcharged with blasphemous
presumption, falsehood, and bigotry."</p>

<p>In this document, the Pope solemnly
and formally asserts his <i>claim</i> to be
the Vicar of Christ on earth! declares
that God has constituted the Pope a
<i>living authority</i> to teach the true sense
of his Heavenly revelations, and to
judge <i>infallibly</i> (infallibili judicia) in all
controversies on faith and morals, and
that "<i>out of the Catholic Church there
is no salvation</i>;" and he bitterly denounces
our "most crafty Bible
societies," (a denunciation simply
against the Bible itself, for there are
no <i>notes</i> of any kind in the Bibles
thus published.)</p>

<p>In this letter, "the Pope will be
found, in the year 1846, to use the
essential terms of the Florentine
Canon, which has been in force for
four hundred and eleven years, and
under whose sanction, consequently,
have been perpetrated, by the Papal
authority, all the enormous crimes
and offences which history records
against it during that long period."</p>

<p>Mr Warren then quotes, as illustrative
of the Pope's assumed supremacy
in <i>temporals</i> over the Papist everywhere,
a conversation detailed in
evidence before a Committee of the
House of Commons.&mdash;'I said to him,
(a respectable Roman Catholic,) suppose
the Pope and his Council announced
that the King of England was
a person who should be deposed&mdash;would
you feel in conscience bound,
as a Roman Catholic, to obey?' He
answered, 'Certainly not, because it
would be contrary to Scripture.'
I asked whether <i>he</i> or his church was
to judge of Scripture? He replied,
'His church.' I then asked, 'If the
decree was so worded, that the Pope
and Council affirmed it to be <i>not</i> contrary,
but according to Scripture,
that a heretical monarch should be
deposed, how would you act?' He
admitted, 'that he should feel himself
<i>bound by the decree</i>, because it was
<i>for the Pope to judge of Scripture</i>, and
that, as a Roman Catholic, he should
<i>obey him</i>.'</p>

<p>In this conversation we have a
perfect specimen of Popish casuistry.
The man is suffered to believe that he
has a <i>conscience</i>, and that he is ever
obedient to <i>Scripture</i>. But Popery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
still holds him fast, and if regicide
should suit its purposes, he can <i>give the
blow</i> with a safe conscience. What
must be the religion when such is the
morality?</p>

<p>And this view leads us to the true
question on which the whole subject
turns. In the eyes of the Tractarians,
the controversy is simply between an
<i>old</i> church and a <i>new</i>. In the apologies
of the apostates, it is simply between
Papal infallibility and private
judgment. Thus, the whole is diluted
into a mere metaphysical inquiry,
while both suppress the entire practical
<i>reality</i> of this tremendous superstition.
In those tranquil subtleties
and meek submissions they both
labour to conceal the <i>fact</i>, that if they
are to be Papists, they <i>must</i> be <i>worshippers</i>
of the Virgin Mary; they
must be worshippers of imaginary
saints; they must be worshippers of
stocks and stones, as the images of
those imaginary saints; and they
must be prepared to do the bidding
of the Papacy, even though that
should amount to the dissolution of
society; for to this they <i>must</i> come.
This is <i>their</i> yoke. To this every
man who apostatises is bound for
life: he must drag the whole length
of the chain.</p>

<p>Strong curiosity is now excited by
the approach of Parliament; and the
inquiry into the measures contemplated
by the Cabinet is intense. In
the midst of the numberless conjectures
hazarded at the moment, a
letter from the Bishop of Durham to
a body of his clergy has appeared;
which, when we remember that the
memorable letter of the Premier was
addressed to the Bishop, and that a
correspondence on the subject may
have been continued, seems to throw
a light on the Ministerial intentions,
and probably has been written for
the <i>express purpose</i>.</p>

<p>The Bishop, after observing that
the question of religious liberty to the
Roman Catholics could not possibly
require "that a foreign potentate
should be permitted to insult a great
nation, trample on the rights of a
sovereign secured by law, and disturb
the peace and good order of the
Established Church," proceeds to
state his conception of the <i>necessary</i>
measures of protection.</p>

<p>"In order to prevent such evils, it
may be necessary to provide&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some restrictions upon the <i>introduction</i>
and <i>circulation</i> of <i>Papal Bulls</i>
in this island.</p>

<p>"To prohibit the <i>assumption of
Episcopal titles</i> conferred by Rome,
and deriving the name from <i>any place
in</i> this country.</p>

<p>"It may also be desirable to forbid
the <i>existence of monastic institutions</i>,
strictly so called.</p>

<p>"Nor can the residence of any
<i>Jesuits</i> appear otherwise than injurious
among Scotch and English Protestants.
This Order is well known
to have shown itself so dangerous,
that it was suppressed by Clement
XIV., 1773, with the approbation of
all wise and good men. What species
or amount of merit may have
brought them again into favour with
Rome, I profess myself unable to
determine. But I am sure you will
agree with me that a body of men,
whose principles and conduct have
been so justly reprobated in (Roman)
Catholic countries, cannot be looked
upon as desirable neighbours among
Protestants like ourselves.</p>

<p>"To some such measures as I have
thus pointed out, it may in all probability
<i>be found necessary to resort</i>;
and they may not improperly be <i>referred
to in petitions</i> presented to
Parliament in the ensuing Session."</p>

<p>Of course it would be essential
that, in the exclusion of Bulls, all
documents asserting any similar authority
over the Popish subjects of the
realm, as "Apostolical Letters," "Rescript
Ordinances," and, in short,
every paper claiming a public right
by the Pope to govern the Papists in
England or Ireland, and in any portion
of the British empire, should be
distinctly comprehended. We must
not suffer ourselves to be cheated by
names. Similarly, it will not be
enough to put down convents and
monasteries, so called, but <i>every</i> institution
in which Popish vows are
taken, binding the rash and unfortunate
people who take them, for life.
Here, too, we must not be cheated by
names. Similarly, we must put down
not merely Jesuits, so called, but
every Order of foreign monk-ism, let it
hide itself under what name it will.
Rome is all <i>artifice</i>, and we may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
well assured that, whether under the
name of Oratorians, or Preachers, or
Brethren of the Spirit, the craft of
Jesuitry will be exercised to make its
way into England, and keep its footing
here.</p>

<p>The Bishop's letter makes no direct
reference to Ireland. But in Ireland
there are <i>two millions</i> of Protestants;
and if Protestantism is to be triumphant
in England, it <i>must</i> be protected
in Ireland. As to the right, the
justice, and the necessity of those
measures, and many more of the same
kind, there can be no doubt on the
mind of any rational being. Lords
Beaumont, Norfolk, and Camoys,
Roman Catholics, have openly stated
that the operation of the Papal Bull,
is <i>incompatible</i> with temporal allegiance
to the Queen. The pamphlet
from which we have quoted so largely,
from a sense of its merits, disposes of
the question in reference to the British
Constitution; and the united feeling
of the nation, which has already, in
the purest spirit of <i>Christian</i> men,
exclaimed "<span class="smcap">No Popery</span>," must now,
in the most determined spirit of <i>Freemen</i>,
exclaim, "<span class="smcap">No Surrender</span>!"</p>
